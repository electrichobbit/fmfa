    <title>Time-Weighted Rates of Return</title>
    <p>
        In the last activity, we saw how to find rates of return for any set of cash flows.  Those cash flows were not invested, but rather income from investments.  For the rest of this chapter, we are going to look at determining rates of return in investment funds, particularly when there is account activity such as deposits and withdrawals.  The goal is to determine how much return was due solely to the fund itself, and not to the account activity. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two approaches to measuring this rate of return.  The <term>time-weighted rate of return</term> measures compound growth rate, while the <term>dollar-weighted</term> (sometimes called <term>money-weighted</term>) rate of return measures simple growth.  We start with the time-weighted rate of return. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that the funds may not be savings accounts or bonds -- they could be accounts such as mutual funds, that can rise or fall.  So you will see some negative growth rates in the activities, exercises, and problems.

                Let's start by making a timeline for this account.  Record in your timeline the balances and the activity for each date.  
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, mark rates of return between consecutive dates in the form <m>(1+j_k)</m> where <m>k = 1,2,3</m> in order.  You can assume each <m>j_k</m> is effective for the given period.

        <task>
            <p>
                The <term>time-weighted rate of return</term> is the equivalent effective annual rate <m>j</m> that takes us from the beginning of the period to the end (in this case, Jan. 1 to Dec. 31 for one year).  This rate only captures the changes due to interest or other investment growth decay. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Using this concept, find an equation for <m>1+j</m> in terms of <m>1+j_1</m>, <m>1+j_2</m>, and <m>1+j_3</m>.

                Our goal is to capture growth or decay that comes from the investment, NOT from the deposits and withdrawals. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To calculate <m>1+j_1</m>, does it make sense to use balances before or after the deposit/withdrawal?  What about <m>1+j_2</m> and <m>1+j_3</m>?  Explain your reasoning.

        So far, we have assumed we are looking at account balances and activity over 1 year.  We can do the same over multiple years -- just remember that the rate is supposed to be an annual rate and compounds over the multiple years.  This will be necessary in the following problem (be sure to pay close attention to the details here!).
