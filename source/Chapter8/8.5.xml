    <title>Dollar-Weighted Rates of Return</title>
    <p>
        In the last activity, we measured the compound rate of return (time-weighted rate of return) on a fund that had its own growth (or decay) in addition to deposits and withdrawals.  In this activity we look at the dollar-weighted rate of return.  This is an attempt to approximate the rate of growth or decay (due solely to the investment) using simple interest. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Recall that the future value equation for simple interest is <me>A(t) = A(0)(1+\iota t)</me> In our problems, <m>t</m> will be between 0 and 1. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The <term>dollar-weighted (money weighted) rate of return</term> is the simple interest rate <m>\iota</m> that, given a starting balance and a sequence of deposits and withdrawals, results in the given ending balance.

                The total amount of interest (or growth, or decay) in the account is <m>I</m>.  Express <m>I</m> in terms of <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>.

            <p>
                Letting <m>\iota</m> denote our dollar-weighted yield rate (and recalling that this is an approximation with simple interest!), write an expression for the value of <m>A</m> at time <m>t=1</m>.

                For the contribution <m>C_k</m> at time <m>t_k</m>, for how long does this contribution earn interest at the simple rate <m>\iota</m> (where "earn" is suitably interpreted if <m>C_k &lt; 0</m>)?

                A fund has a balance of 1000 at the beginning of the year. If 200 is added to the fund at the end of three months and if 300 is withdrawn from the fund at the end of nine months, the dollar-weighted rate of return is 4%. Find the ending balance.

            <p>
                Does the formula for the dollar-weighted rate of return help, or is it a distraction?
