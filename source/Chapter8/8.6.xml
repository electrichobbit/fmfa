	<title>Problem Solving 11 -- Mixing Time and Dollar-Weighted Returns</title>
	<p>
		Several problems involve using both time and dollar-weighted rates of return to solve for an unknown value. 
	</p>
	<p>
		&#9888; Our methods for calculating the time-weighted rate of return result in finding <m>1\! +\! \iota</m>, while for dollar-weighted rates of return, we get <m>\iota</m>. This is a common source of errors on these problems, particularly when you are told that some time-weighted rate of return equals some other dollar-weighted rate of return. 
	</p>
	<activity xml:id="finding-both-time-and-dollar-weighted-rates">
		<statement>
			<p>
				Some problems just ask us to find both a time-weighted and dollar-weighted rate of return for an account with activity.  A multiple choice problem may ask you to do something like subtract or divide the results (so as to have a single answer). 
			</p>
			<p>
				Fund <m>X</m> has unit values which are 1.0 on January 1, 2015, 0.8 on July 1, 2015, and 1.0 on January 1, 2016. A fund manager receives contributions of 100,000 on January 1, 2015 and 100,000 on July 1, 2015 and immediately uses the entirety of each contribution to purchase units of Fund <m>X</m>. Find the time-weighted and dollar-weighted rates of return for 2015. 
			</p>

	<activity xml:id="finding-the-leverage-variable-from-weighted-rate">
		<introduction>
			<p>
				Other problems require you to use one of the two rates to find the value of a leverage variable, and then use that leverage variable to solve the problem. 
			</p>
			<p>
				You invest 2000 at time <m>t=0</m> and an additional 1000 at time <m>t = 1/2</m>. At time <m>t = 1</m> you have 3200 in your account. Find the amount that would have to be in your account at time <m>t = 1/2</m> if the time-weighted rate of return over the year is exactly 0.02 higher than the dollar-weighted rate of return.
