	<title>Ethics Case Study -- Redlining</title>
	<p>
		<term>Redlining</term> was the practice of limiting home mortgage loans to low-income neighborhoods based on factors other than financial qualification: the name comes from maps in which neighborhoods were outlined in red. 
	</p>
	<p>
		While racially motivated redlining was made illegal under the Fair Housing Act in 1968, the effects have lingered. In this activity, we'll consider some of these effects and how they might be remedied.

				Before we start, read about the <url href="https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/a-framework-for-ethical-decision-making/">six ethical lenses published by the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University</url>. Which lens(es) do you think you will bring to this analysis?

				Read about the history of redlining in this <url href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/redlining">article on the Federal Reserve's website</url>. Which aspect(s) of this history surprise you the most?

				One way the effect of redlining continues to be felt is through school funding. Schools are funded by property taxes, giving a direct link between the wealth of a neighborhood and the funding received by the neighborhood's schools. Explain how redlining impacts school funding, and the cyclic problem that this creates. In addition, identify the assumptions we make in asserting that there is a cyclic problem.

				We can also examine whether or not there is currently any racial discrimination in the real estate market. Google “racial differences in mortgage lending” and "steering in real estate" and describe what you find. You can follow up with other search terms as well.

				You are on the staff of the director of your county's housing office. The director has requested three proposals for measures the county can take to counteract the effects of redlining. You are to submit a report with an analysis of each of them and a recommendation for the one you think is most appropriate.
			</p>
		</task>
		<task>
			<p>
				Let’s do a stakeholder analysis. Make a list of all those who would be impacted by implementing the measures you are considering. Include both primary stakeholders (directly affected) and secondary stakeholders (indirectly affected). Try to see the situation through the eyes of all possible stakeholders.
			</p>
		</task>
		<task>
			<p>
				Test your options by determining how the stakeholders you identified are harmed or benefited by implementing or not implementing these structures. Test options by filling in the following tables. You can add rows for more stakeholders and make additional tables for more options.

			<table>

				Make a decision: write a report to the director explaining and analyzing your three proposed measures. State your recommendation first, and then justify your decision with explicit reference to the stakeholder analysis.

			<p>
				Finally, reflect on your decision. What was the nature of your justification? Look back at the ethical lenses from Santa Clara University. Which lens(es) best fit your recommendation? Was that the same or different from what you identified at the beginning of this activity? Does that surprise you? Why or why not? Write a brief paragraph responding to these questions and include it with your report.
