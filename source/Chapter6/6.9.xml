	<title>Ethics Case Study -- Redlining</title>
	<p>
		<term>Redlining</term> was the practice of limiting minority home mortgage loans to low-income neighborhoods.  The name comes from maps in which neighborhoods were outlined in red.  While the practice was made illegal under the Fair Housing Act in 1968, the effects have lingered.  Is it time for new government action? 
	</p>
	<p>
		We will go through our ethical decision-making process to consider the issue.

				<em>Step 2</em>: Gather the Facts.
			</p>
			<p>
 				One way the effect of redlining continues to be felt is through school funding.  Schools are funded by property taxes, giving a direct link between the wealth of a neighborhood and the funding received by the neighborhood's schools.  Explain how redlining impacts school funding, and the cyclic problem that this creates.  In addition, identify the assumptions we make in asserting that there is a cyclic problem.

 				We can also examine whether or not there is any racial discrimination in the mortgage loan market.  Google the following: "racial differences in mortgage lending" and describe what you find.  You can follow-up with other search terms as well.

				<em>Step 3</em>: Identify stakeholders.  Consider both primary stakeholders (directly affected) and secondary stakeholders (indirectly affected).  Try to see the situation through the eyes of all possible stakeholders.

	<activity xml:id="redlining-develop-options">

				<em>Step 4</em>: Develop options.  Be imaginative, avoid dilemmas or yes/no situations. Instead consider how to modify questions and ask “to/for whom” or “how much."

	<activity xml:id="redlining-test-options">

			<p> 
				<em>Step 5</em>: Test options by determining how the stakeholders you identified are harmed or benefited by an action or inaction.  Test at least two options by filling in the following tables.  You can add rows for more stakeholders, and make additional tables for more options.
