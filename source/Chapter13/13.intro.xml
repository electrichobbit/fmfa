		When I was in college, I had a checking account at Michigan National Bank. When I would go to their ATMs, I saw signs with a picture of two men (because of course it was men) in suits looking as excited as if they just stepped off a roller coaster ride.  The ad read "Hello great rates!" 
	</p>

		I wondered to myself - what makes a rate great? If I was borrowing, I would want a low rate.  But if I was saving, I would want a higher rate.  Which of these situations were these excited men in?  Was the bank suggesting that their rates were low or high?

		Decades later, I know now that the ad was supposed to let the reader draw whatever conclusion that they wanted.  I was not as cynical back then.

		Whether or not a rate is "great" we can ask how rates are determined.  This will be the focus of this final chapter.  So far, you have been given rates.  Occasionally, we have used zero-coupon bond markets to find yields.  But what about the interest rates changed to borrowers by a bank? Or interest rates offered savers and investors?  Where do these rates come from?
