	<title>The Role of the Federal Reserve</title>
	<p>
		In modern economies, central banks play an important role in maintaining a national monetary system.  In the United States, the functions of a central bank are handled by the Federal Reserve System (established in 1913).  In this section, we will examine the role of central banks in general, and the Federal Reserve in particular. 
	</p>
	<p>
		As with <xref ref="interest-rate-components-in-context"/>, the Study Note includes a wealth of empirical facts that could be tested. We do not claim that this section is comprehensive in that respect.  We recommend you supplement this activity with a careful reading of the study note. 
	</p>
	<p>
		We begin with central banks.  Central banks have two main functions -- to facilitate payment systems and to act as a lender of last resort to commercial banks.

				Which function of a central bank is represented by the following scenarios?

			<p>
				A commercial bank needs to borrow funds overnight to satisfy demands from savings account holders.

		</task>
		<task>

				A customer pays for their coffee with a debit card.  The customer banks with McCord Bank.  The coffee house banks with Morejon Bank.  Funds are transferred from McCord Bank's reserve account to Morejon Bank, and funds from McCord Bank are transferred back into their reserve account.

	<activity xml:id="reserve-requriement">
		<introduction>
			<p>
				Central banks require every bank in their system to maintain a specific amount of funds in it called the bank's <term>reserve requirement</term>.  The account is the bank's <term>reserve</term>.

		</introduction>
		<task>
			<p>
				Come up with at least one reason why banks would have reserve requirements.

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						The importance of McCord Bank in the overall payment system.

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The Central Bank's need to satisfy demands of individuals (people) who hold savings accounts with them.

		A bank's reserve can be used for overnight transfer to facilitate payments, but the bank has to make sure their reserve requirement continues to be met.

		In their role as lenders of last resort, central banks use reserve accounts as a source of funds.  In addition, some central banks (but not all) are authorized to issue currency.  In addition to supporting their role as lenders of last resort, the authority for actions such as issuing currency allows the central bank to set monetary policy by controlling the supply of money and setting interest rates.  Monetary policy has an impact on inflation and unemployment.  In the United States, although the Federal Reserve sets monetary policy, they are not authorized to issue currency.  Their tools are less direct (as we will see).

		In the United States, the central bank functions are handled by the Federal Reserve System.  The Federal Reserve System is made up of 12 regional banks together with a committee called the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC).  The regional banks and the FOMC are governed by the Board of Governors.  
	</p>
	<p>
		The Federal Reserve is authorized to take monetary action to help control inflation and unemployment, but they are not authorized to issue currency.  Instead, they set interest rate targets through market activities.  The FOMC determines a target rate and the regional banks buy and sell T-Bills in the open market in order to try to achieve that rate.

		<statement>
			<p>
				Sketch a diagram illustrating the components of the U.S. Federal Reserve System.
			</p>
		</statement>
	</activity>
	<p>
		To be more specific, the Federal Reserve is able to manage two different interest rates.  The <term>federal funds rate</term> is the interest rates banks charge one another for overnight loans.  Overnight loans will be necessary when reserves fall below their requirement. The FOMC sets federal funds rate targets to be achieved through T-Bill purchases and sales by the regional banks. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The other rate, directly controlled by the Federal Reserve, is the rate at which commercial banks borrow directly from the Federal Reserve.  This is called the <term>discount rate</term> and comes from the <term>discount window</term>.  Banks prefer to borrow from other banks as it shows that they are creditworthy.

				On a given day, the discount rate is 3.65%, the prime rate is 3.55%, the LIBOR is 3.30%, the federal funds rate is 3.25%, and the federal funds target rate is 3.20%.
