				<xref ref="bibliography-soa"/> Porter makes three-year loans that include inflation protection. The annual interest rate compounded
				continuously that must be paid is 3.2% plus the rate of inflation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The U.S. government borrows 100,000 for three years from Porter. The actual annual inflation rate
				during the first year was 2.4% compounded continuously. The actual annual inflation rates for the
				second and third years respectively was 2.8% and 4.2% compounded continuously. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The U.S. government is considered a risk free borrower, which means there is no chance of default. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Calculate the amount that the U.S. government will owe Porter at the end of three years.

				<xref ref="bibliography-ca"/> David has capital of one million. He plans to lend his money to potential borrowers for a term of two
				years. David expects to gain 60,000 as interest from this investment. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Jacob, a potential borrower, wants to open a bakery. Unfortunately, he needs a loan of a term of at least
				five years. Jacob heard of Davidâ€™s investment plans and proposed a higher interest amount to convince
				David to lend him money. The increase is high enough that David is willing to lend Jacob some
				money.

				<xref ref="bibliography-soa"/> Anderson Bank offers a five-year loan. It is repaid with a single payment of principal and interest at time five. Anderson wants to receive an annual rate of 5% compounded continuously to reflect deferred compensation. For this loan, the percentage of borrowers that will default is 0.7%. From the loans that are defaults, Anderson Bank will be able to recover 30% of the amount owed after five years.

				<li>
					<p>
						When the bond's coupons are indexed to inflation, the security is labeled a "nominal return bond" rather than a "real return bond."

					<p>
						"Real return bonds" are more commonly issued than "nominal return bonds."

					<p>
						The U.S. government is able to assume inflation risk because its tax receipts are directly linked to inflation rates.
