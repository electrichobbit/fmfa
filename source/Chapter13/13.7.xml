	<title>Ethics Case Study -- Audit the Fed</title>
	<p>
		Libertarians and some conservatives often call for legislation to audit the Federal Reserve.  While the Federal Reserve is subject to regular internal audits by independent inspectors general, external expert auditors, and more generally is subject to review by the Government Accountability Office, the calls to "audit the Fed" are based on seeking greater and more detailed Congressional oversight.  In effect, the creation of the central bank took the details of monetary policy out of democratic control.  By way of contrast, the details of fiscal policy (such as setting marginal tax rates and the federal budget) are entirely within Congress' control.

		You are consulting an independent Senator on the Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2015.  The legislation was passed by the House of Representatives, partly as a response to the 2008 financial crisis, and is now before the Senate.  You have been asked to consider whether voting for the bill is the ethical course of action.

				Ben Bernanke was chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors from 2006 to 2014.  Read his analysis of the bill at <url href="https://bit.ly/BBAuditFed"/>. You can read the actual bill (although you might have to chase back references) at <url href="https://bit.ly/AuditFedBill"/>. One of the studies Bernanke cites is at <url href="https://bit.ly/FedStudyDomestic"/>, and another (which analyzes the impact of central banking on countries transitioning away from communism) can be accessed at <url href="https://bit.ly/AuditFedTransition"/>.
