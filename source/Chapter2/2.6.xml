	<title>Equivalent Accumulation Rates</title>
	<p>
		We would like to pause and consider a more comprehensive way to think about converting between various discount and interest rates.  There are two limitations we have to work with.  As we noted in <xref ref="compound-interest-and-timeline-reasoning"/>, nominal rates are useless for calculations.  So the first limitation is that we cannot perform rate conversions using nominal rates.  Secondly, our conversion formulas between discount and interest will return a rate with the same period as the original rate.  If we convert an effective monthly discount rate to an interest rate, the result will be an effective monthly interest rate.  What this means is that in conversions, we first need an effective rate, then we convert, then we adjust to get the rate we need.

		<statement>
			<p> 
				So far in <xref ref="other-forms-of-interest-accumulation"/>, we have met two new ways to accumulate interest.  The first is simple interest, the second is discount.  Given a simple interest rate, there are no equivalent compound interest rates.  However, given a discount rate, there are equivalent interest rates.  Why is this?
