	<title>Spot Rates and Forward Rates</title>
	<p>
		In <xref ref="term-structure-interest-rates"/>, we will meet spot rates and forward rates.  A <term>spot rate</term> is an effective annual interest rate offered today (time 0) for investment for a period of time.  For example, the spot rate <m>s_0(1)</m> is the annual rate offered now for a 1-year investment, and <m>s_0(2)</m> is the <term>annual</term> rate offered now for a 2-year investment.  A <term>forward rate</term> is a 1-year rate over a period that is implied by spot rates.  So given <m>s_0(1)</m> and <m>s_0(2)</m>, there is an implied <term>forward rate</term> <m>\iota_0(1,2)</m> for the time between Years 1 and 2.  There zeros in the subscripts just indicate that we are thinking of investments made today. Let us take a look at how this works!

		<introduction>
			<p> 
				Suppose we have spot rates <m>s_0(1) = 2\%</m> for a 1-year investment today and <m>s_0(2) = 3.5\%</m> for a 2-year investment today.
			</p>
		</introduction>
		<task>
			<p> 
				Generate an interest rate timeline.  Remember that <m>s_0(1)</m> is in effect between years 0 and 1, <m>s_0(2)</m> is a 1-year rate but in effect between years 0 and 2, and <m>\iota_0(1,2)</m> is a rate that is expected to be in effect between years 1 and 2.

		</task>
		<task>
			<p> 
				In order for the market to work (based on the <term>no-arbitrage rule</term>), the two options above must yield the same value at the end of the 2-year period.  Use this to set up and solve an equation for <m>\iota_0(1,2)</m>.
