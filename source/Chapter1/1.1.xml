	<title>Introduction to Interest Theory</title>
	<p>
		Before we begin understanding finance, we should think about why finance is important for actuaries.
	</p>
	<p>
		Actuaries quantify and model risk for insurance companies.  The basic insurance contract involves a customer paying a fee (a <term>premium</term>) to the company in exchange for the company agreeing to pay the costs of one or more contingencies over a specified period of time. If you own a car or have health insurance, you have paid premiums.  Actuaries use data to assess the probability and cost of the covered contingencies, often averaging over a large population.
