	<title>Review -- Equations that are Quadratic in Form</title>
	<p>
		Quadratic equations come up often in the problems, but it is not always obvious how.  Sometimes it seems like an "algebra trick."
	</p>
	<p>
		Recall that the quadratic formula says that the solutions to the equation <m>ax^2+bx+c = 0</m> are <me>x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}</me>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have not yet committed this to memory, now is the time. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In our problems, quadratic equations will often be disguised, or "quadratic in form."  These equations look like <me>a[f(x)]^2+b[f(x)]+c = 0</me> for some fucntion <m>f(x)</m>.  To solve these equations, first use the quadratic formula to solve for possible values of <m>f(x)</m>, then solve for the values of <m>x</m>.  Some like to use an explicit substitution <m>u=f(x)</m>.
