		We begin by developing financial intuition.  Our intuition is based on compound interest.  While there are other ways to accumulate interest, compound interest is the most common.

		The most important tool for our intuition is what is called a timeline.  A timeline is a number line decorated with indications of deposits and withdrawals into an accent.  As interest accumulates, we move forward along the timeline - we will informally call this "pushing forward." On the other hand, to figure out what needs to be deposited earlier on the timeline in order for the funds to balance, we "pull back" along the timeline.
