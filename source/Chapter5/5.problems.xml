				<xref ref="bibliography-vaaler-daniel"/> Al and Sal are twins. Al is given a fifteen-year annuity with end-of-year payments. The first payment Al receives, precisely one year from the date he is given the annuity, is for 100, and then subsequent payments decrease by 4% annually. Sal is given an <m>n</m>-year level annuity that has the same present value as Al's when the present values are calculated using <m>\iota = 5\%</m>. Again, calculated using <m>\iota = 5\%</m>, the accumulated value at the end of <m>n</m> years of Sal's annuity is 1,626.29. Find the common present value of the two annuities and then find <m>n</m>.

				A <term>forward contract</term> is a contract to purchase something at a point in the future.  If payment is made at the time of the contract, this is called a <term>prepaid forward</term>.  For a share of stock, the price of a prepaid forward is the current stock price minus the present value of the dividends that will be issued prior to delivery.  This is an adjustment due to the fact that the buyer does not get any of the dividends issued prior to delivery of the stock.
