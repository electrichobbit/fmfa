	<title>Deriving Formulas for Increasing and Decreasing Annuities</title>
	<p>
		In this optional section, we will derive the formulas for <m>(Is)_{\angln}</m> and <m>(Da)_{\angln}</m> using chunking.

				To lay a foundation, write the series representations for each of the following (a timeline may help).  You will have to recognize these series representations in the derivation.

				We will derive the formula for <m>(Is)_{\angln}</m> first.  We will do this in two steps.
			</p>
		</introduction>
		<task>
			<p> 
				Make a timeline for an increasing annuity with payments of 1, 2, ..., <m>n</m>.  But chunk the annuity so that you have a bunch of level-payment annuities, each of which has payments of 1, but has different terms.
			</p>
		</task>
		<task>
			<p> 
				Use your timeline to write down an expression using a bunch of <m>s_{\angl{k}}</m> terms whose value is equal to <m>(Is)_{\angln}</m>.  Then use the formula for each <m>s_{\angl{k}}</m> to derive the formula for <m>(Is)_{\angln}</m>.  At some point in your work, you should see one of the series representations above.
