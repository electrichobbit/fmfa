		So far the payments for our annuities have been level, or we could chunk our annuities into 2 or 3 level-payment annuities.  In this chapter, we will look closely at two different ways the payments of annuities can change during the term.  The first type involves payments in geometric progression, meaning the payments grow or decline by a constant percentage amount.  The second type involves payments in arithmetic progression, meaning the payments grow or decline by a constant absolute amount.
