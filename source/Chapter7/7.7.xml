	<title>Ethics Case Study -- Mortgage-Backed Securities and the 2008 Financial Crisis</title>
	<p>
		Lehman Brothers was one of several banks that were "too big to fail" - meaning their role in the economy was so large that if they went bankrupt, there could be a global financial crisis. When I think of this, I think of a handful of pieces in a Jenga puzzle that keep the structure from collapsing. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was a <term>securitization</term> boom.  A securitization is an issue of bonds whose payments come from the income of an asset (cash flow).  The most common are <term>mortgage-backed securities</term> in which the asset backing the bond is a pool of mortgage loans. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Lehman Brothers invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities, particularly mortgage-backed securities from <term>subprime mortgages</term> -- mortgages with high interest rates and high-risk borrowers.  Subprime loans often had adjustable interest rates, and as the housing market began to fall in 2007, those interest rates grew to the point where borrower's  could not make their payments.  As a result, there was a large wave of defaults.  As the mortgages defaulted, the issuers of the mortgage-backed securities defaulted, contributing significantly to the 2008 financial crisis.  The most conspicuous events of the crisis was the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers (who retained my prior law firm, Weil, Gotshal, and Manges) and the Wall Street bailout.  In 2010, Congress passed and President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act designed to curb the behaviors that led to the crisis.

		For our purposes, let's suppose you work for an investment bank in the early years of securitization and are asked by a partner in the firm whether to get into this "mortgage-backed security game".  She tells you that she has heard of firms earning massive returns from subprime mortgages, and after all, who doesn't pay their mortgage?

				<em>Step 2</em>: Gather the Facts.
			</p>
			<p>
				First, let's understand how mortgage-backed securities work with a simple example.  Suppose a bank securitizes three mortgages.  The first, mortgage <m>X</m>, is a 10-year mortgage with loan amount 100,000 and an effective monthly interest rate of 1.25\%.  The second mortgage, <m>Y</m>, is a 15-year mortgage with loan amount 250,000 and an effective monthly interest rate of 3.5\%.  The third, <m>Z</m>, has a loan amount of 200,000 and an effective monthly interest rate of 2\%.  The bank issues 1000 bonds backed by these three mortgages.  The bond has no redemption, and monthly coupons equal to a share of the monthly payments made by the borrowers (the share is equal to the proportion of the 1000 bonds an investor purchases).

		<task>
			<p>
				Price the bond to yield 4\% monthly.
			</p>
		</task>
		<task>
			<p>
				Typically, the original lenders of mortgages sell the loans to larger banks, who bundle and securitize them.  Who carries the risk of loss due to default?  What incentives does this send to the original lenders?  Where is there potential for fraud?

				How do borrowers benefit from securitization?  Why should we avoid rushing to judgment about mortgage-backed securities or the firms who issued them?

				<em>Step 3</em>: Identify stakeholders.  Consider both primary stakeholders (directly affected) and secondary stakeholders (indirectly affected).  Try to see the situation through the eyes of all possible stakeholders.

	<activity xml:id="mortgage-backed-securities-test-options">

				<em>Step 5</em>: Test options by determining how the stakeholders you identified are harmed or benefited by an action or inaction.  Test at least two options by filling in the following tables.  You can add rows for more stakeholders, and make additional tables for more options.
