  <title>Arbitrage Revisited</title>
  <p>
    In the last activity, you used arbitrage arguments to relate spot rates and forward rates.  Nevertheless, since spot rates and forward rates are market-driven, they may not match and therefore there may be an opportunity for arbitrage. 
  </p>
  <p>
    When arbitrage exists, you can construct a transaction to take advantage of the opportunity buy following the age-old "buy-low, sell-high" strategy.  In order to do this, you will have to create a "synthetic" version of the transaction that would occur if there were no arbitrage.  You will do this quite a bit when preparing for the IFM Exam.  In this activity, we will get a taste of this using forward and spot rates. 
  </p>
  <p>
    &#9888; Note that borrowing and paying back in a lump sum is the same as selling a zero-coupon bond, and lending with a lump sum repayment is the same as buying a zero-coupon bond. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We begin by exploring synthetic investments (sometimes called a "net position").  Then we use them to construct arbitrage transactions.

        Suppose you want to borrow 100 at time 1 at the implied forward rate, with the total to be paid back at the end of year 2.  Write down the net cash flows in years 0, 1, and 2.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you purchase a 2-year zero-coupon bond with <m>F = 100</m>, and sell a 1-year zero coupon bond for a price of 100, what are your net cash flows in years 0, 1, and 2?
      </p>

    <task>
      <p>
        If you sell a 2-year zero coupon bond for a price of 95.238 , and use all of the proceeds to purchase a 1-year zero-coupon bond, what are your net cash flows in years 0, 1, and 2?

        Of the two transactions with the zero-coupon bonds, which has net annual cash flows that match the desired transaction?  This is the "synthetic" transaction.
