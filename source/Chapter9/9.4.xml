	<title>Implied Forward Rates and Spot Rates</title>
	<p>
		Given a yield curve, the spot rates imply forward rates -- otherwise there would be an arbitrage opportunity. Similarly, given a set of forward rates, there is an implied yield curve.  In this activity, we will figure learn how to figure these out. 
	</p>
	<p>
		For ease of notation, we will write <m>s_k</m> in place of <m>s_0(k)</m> in this activity.

		<introduction>
			<p>
				Suppose we know the yield curve <m>s_k</m> for <m>k = 1, \ldots, n</m> and we want to find <m>\iota_0(n-1,n)</m>.  The following approach (whether with or without the timeline) is called "making an arbitrage argument."
			</p>
		</introduction>
		<task>
			<p>
				Make an interest rate timeline which shows two paths from 0 to <m>n</m>: one using <m>s_n</m> and another using <m>s_{n-1}</m> and <m>\iota_0(n-1,n)</m>.
			</p>
		</task>
		<task>
			<p>
				Assume that an investor can borrow and lend along both paths without transaction costs.  Show that if the two paths you plotted do not result in the same value at time <m>n</m>, arbitrage is possible.  Address both the case where the path using <m>s_{n-1}</m> and <m>\iota_0(n-1)</m>  results in a larger amount and the case where that path results in a smaller amount. 
			</p>
		</task>
		<task>
			<p>
				Assuming there is no arbitrage, write down an equation that must hold concerning the two paths, and solve your equation for <m>\iota_0(n-1,n)</m>.  This is called the <term>implied forward rate</term>.

			<p>
				Consider the following two yield curves (representing perhaps annual yields on two different classes of zero coupon bonds), valid for <m>k = 1, 2, \ldots, 10</m>:
