	<title>Review -- Difference of Squares</title>
	<p>
		We begin with a review of a factoring technique that tends to come surprisingly often in annuity problems: the difference of squares.  Recall that the factoring approach for the difference of squares is:

	<me>x^2-y^2 = (x-y)(x+y)</me>

		<statement>
			<p> 
				On the first day of every January, April, July, and October Smith deposits 100 in an account earning <m>\iota^{(4)} = 0.16</m>. He continues the deposits until he accumulates a sufficient balance to begin withdrawals of 200 every 3 months, starting 3 months after the final deposit, such that he can make twice as many withdrawals as he made deposits. How many deposits are needed?
