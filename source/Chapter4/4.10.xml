  <title>Continuously Payable Annuities</title>
  <p>
    A continuously payable annuity is an annuity where the payment is "smeared out" over time.  The payment is then quoted as a rate, such as <m>K</m> per year or <m>K</m> per month.  These come up rarely on the FM exam, but are covered here for completion. 
  </p>
  <p>
    To match the interest rate period with the payment period, we use the continuous compounding rate.  This is the (constant) force of interest <m>\delta</m>. The notation for future and present value are <m>\overline{s}_{\angln \iota}</m> and <m>\overline{a}_{\angln \iota}</m>.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Since our payments are "smeared out" we can think of this as taking payments of <m>\frac{1}{m}</m> <m>m</m> times per year, and then take the limit as <m>m\to\infty</m>.
      </p>

        If the effective annual rate is <m>\iota</m>, what is the effective <m>m</m>-times a year rate?
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p>
        Using your effective <m>m</m>-times a year rate, what would be the future value of an annuity which pays <m>\frac{1}{m}</m> <m>m</m> times a year for <m>n</m> years?

      <p>
        The denominator of your fraction is <m>m((1+\iota)^{\frac{1}{m}} -1)</m>.  What is the limit as <m>m\to\infty</m>? Hint: Use L'Hopital's rule - this is of the form <m>\infty - \infty</m>.

        Using your work above, fill in a formula for <m>\overline{s}_{\angln \iota}</m> and guess a formula for <m>\overline{a}_{\angln \iota}</m>. The derivation for <m>\overline{a}_{\angln \iota}</m> follows the same process.
