	<title>Chunking</title>
	<p>
		So far, we have assumed that the payments and the interest rates were the same throughout the lifetime of an annuity.  We can relax those assumptions in various ways.  One way we can do so is to assume a small, finite number of different payments.  We can also assume a small, finite number of different (consecutive) interest rates.  Usually small, finite means 2 (possibly 3).  
	</p>
	<p>
		To handle these examples, we can break our payments into more than 1 annuity, where each annuity has a constant payment and a constant interest rate.  I sometimes refer to this approach as "chunking" (breaking the cash flows into "chunks" - separate annuities).

		<title>&#x1F9EE; Calculator Tip </title> 
		<p>
			I typically use the financial calculator to value each "chunk" at an appropriate time, and type them immediately into my other calculator (with appropriate operations) as I get them, keeping all decimal places for accuracy.

		<introduction>
			<p> 
				We start by analyzing and solving a problem. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A loan of 10,000 is being repaid in 10 semiannual payments, with the first payment made one-half year after the loan. The first five payments are <m>K</m> each, and the final five payments are <m>K+200</m> each.  What is <m>K</m> if <m>\iota^{(2)} = .06</m>?

				Identify two or more annuities in this problem.

		<task>
			<p> 
				Sketch a timeline for this problem including all annuities (separated out), the original 10,000 loan, and where you want to value everything.

		<task>
			<p> 
				Use your timeline to write an equation, then solve the equation.

				Find a second way to chunk the annuity and solve the problem.  Which approach do you prefer? Why?
