  <title>Review - Geometric Sequences and Series 1: Re-indexing</title>
  <p>
    The other preliminary discussion we need before diving into annuities concerns geometric series.  We have the geometric series formula that tells us the sum:
  </p>
  <me>\sum_{\ell=0}^{n-1} = at^{\ell} = a \left(\frac{1-t^n}{1-t}\right)</me>
  <p>
    Notice that the sum starts at 0.  What if we want to sum something like the following?
  </p>
  <me>\sum_{\ell=3}^{143} 5 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{\ell}</me>
  <p>
    Since that sum does not start at 0, we have to make some modifications.  This will be useful for probability as well as finance.

  <activity xml:id="summing-geometric-series">
    <introduction>
      <p> 
        We can start by summing a few basic geometric series.  Find the sum of each of the following:
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
      <p>
        <m>\displaystyle{\sum_{\ell=0}^{11}} 7 \cdot 9^{\ell}</m>
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p> 
        <m>\displaystyle{\sum_{\ell=0}^{119}} 3 \cdot \left(\frac{7}{2}\right)^{\ell}</m>
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p> 
        <m>\displaystyle{\sum_{\ell=0}^{6}} 12 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{\ell}</m>
      </p>
    </task>
  </activity>
  <activity xml:id="summing-geometric-series-different-start">
    <introduction>
      <p> 
        Now suppose we want to start at some value of the index besides 0.  We would like to find a way to sum the following:
        <me>\sum_{\ell=k}^{n-1} at^{\ell}</me>
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
      <p> 
        Find the greatest common factor of all of the terms we are adding, and factor it out.  It might help to write the series out in long form, but write your final factored expression using summation notation.
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p> 
        Now we substitute a new index <m>m</m> in place of <m>\ell</m>.  This is called re-indexing, and is similar to integration by substitution (without worrying about <m>dx</m>).  Find an equation for the new index <m>m</m> in terms of <m>\ell</m>, make the substitution (change the lower and upper bounds of the sum, and the terms of the sum), and rewrite the result.  Then sum.

        Use your result to find the following sums:

        Now we will find the present value of an annuity (actually, an annuity-immediate).  The following timeline represents an annuity in which there are <m>n</m> periodic payments of <m>K</m>, paid at the end of each period.  Assume <m>\iota</m> is the effective periodic interest rate, and <m>v</m> is the corresponding present value factor.

            \begin{tikzpicture}
            \draw[line width=1pt] (0,0) -- node[below=1mm,pos=0.6,scale=2] {$\cdots$} (10,0);
            \foreach \x/\y in {0/0}{
            \draw[line width=1pt] (\x,-2mm)node[below](\x){\strut\y} -- (\x,1mm)node[above]{$Ka_{\angln}$};
            }
            \foreach \x/\y in {1/1,2/2,3/3,9/$n-1$,10/$n$}{
            \draw[line width=1pt] (\x,-2mm)node[below](\x){\strut\y} -- (\x,2mm)node[above]{$K$};
            }
            % \draw[-latex] (0,-7mm) -- +(0,-10mm)node[below]{$a_{\angln \iota}$};
            \draw (0.8,1.5mm) rectangle (10.2,7mm); 
            \draw[->] (0.8,4mm)--(0.4,4mm);
            \end{tikzpicture}

      </figure>
      <p>
        The present value is denoted <m>Ka_{\angln \iota}</m>, although (as in this timeline) this is shortened to <m>Ka_{\angln}</m> when the interest rate is understood.  As indicated in the timeline, this is the value at time 0, one period <term>before</term> the first payment.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
      <p> 
        Write the present value as the sum of the present values of each payment (this is called the <term>series representation</term>).  Be careful about where your sum begins and ends!
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p> 
        Use what we have learned in this activity to find a closed-form formula for the sum.
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p> 
        Note the following: <me>\frac{v}{1-v} = \frac{1}{\iota}</me> (Can you show why this is true?)  Use this identity to rewrite your result for <m>Ka_{\angln \iota}</m>.  This is the present value formula for an annuity immediate.
