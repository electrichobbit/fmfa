  <title>Actuarial Notation 2 -- <m>a_{\angln \iota}</m> and <m>s_{\angln \iota}</m></title>
  <p>
    The present value of an annuity immediate for <m>n</m> periods with interest rate <m>\iota</m> and payments of 1 is denoted:
  </p>
  <me>a_{\angln \iota}</me>
  <p>
    The present value of an perpetuity immediate with interest rate <m>\iota</m> and payments of 1 is denoted:
  </p>
  <me>a_{\angl\infty \iota}</me>
  <p>
    The accumulated (future) value of an annuity for <m>n</m> periods with interest rate <m>\iota</m> and payments of 1 is denoted:
  </p>
  <me>s_{\angln \iota}</me>
  <p>
    If the payments are <m>K</m> instead of 1, just multiply: <m>Ka_{\angln \iota}</m>, <m>Ka_{\angl\infty \iota}</m>, and <m>Ks_{\angln \iota}</m>. If the interest rate is understood, we often omit it from the notation and just write <m>Ka_{\angln}</m> and <m>Ks_{\angln}</m>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The problems from <xref ref="introduction-to-immediate-annuities"/> are repeated below with timelines.  Your task is to decide where to value the cash flows and write one or more equations to solve the problem, using actuarial notation as appropriate.  <em>We are not going to solve these problems until the next activity.</em>

        To accumulate 8000 at the end of 3<m>n</m> years, deposits of 98 are made at the end of each of the first <m>n</m> years and 196 at the end of each of the next 2<m>n</m> years.  The effective annual rate of interest is <m>\iota</m>. You are given <m>(1+\iota)^n = 2.0.</m> Determine <m>\iota</m>.

        A generous, anonymous donor purchases an annuity immediate for <m>X</m> with annual payments <m>K</m> for 20 years.  She deposits the annual payments into an account earning an effective annual interest rate of 5%.  At the end of the 20 years, the accumulated amount is to be paid over to Tom Riddle.  By the end of the 20 years, Tom Riddle has become Lord Voldemort, who expects to live forever.  Voldemort uses the payout to purchase a perpetuity immediate that pays out 500 at the end of every year valued with an effective annual interest rate of 4%.
