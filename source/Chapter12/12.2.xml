	<title>Exact Matching with Coupon Bonds</title>
	<p>
		In <xref ref="exact-matching-with-zero-coupon-bonds"/> we used zero-coupon bonds to exactly match our liabilities.  It gets a little more complicated when we use coupon bonds.  We assume that we can purchase coupon bonds for any amount of face value.

		<introduction>
			<p>
				Suppose we have a single liability of 1000 due at the end of 1 year.  The only investment available is a one-year bond with a single annual coupon at 5% of face value, paid together with the redemption amount.  The yield rate is an effective annual rate of 6%.
