  "title": "Introduction to Interest Theory",
  "body": " Introduction to Interest Theory  Before we begin understanding finance, we should think about why finance is important for actuaries.  Actuaries quantify and model risk for insurance companies. The basic insurance contract involves a customer paying a fee (a premium ) to the company in exchange for the company agreeing to pay the costs of one or more contingencies over a specified period of time. If you own a car or have health insurance, you have paid premiums. Actuaries use data to assess the probability and cost of the covered contingencies, often averaging over a large population.    What role do you think investments play in insurance?    Interest on an investment (like a loan, for example) includes compensation for what is called \"deferred consumption\" as well as compensation for risk. What risks are associated with a financial investment that interest compensates for?    Let us pause and consider the ethics of insurance contracts. Why should an individual pay an insurance company when they can invest the premium themselves, or consult an investment banker to do so?    "

  "title": "Timelines",
  "body": " Timelines  The key to financial mathematics is understanding the special role time plays in finance. Money today is worth more than money later due to deferred compensation as well as a variety of risks, such as inflation and non-payment.  A cash flow is a sequence of payments, such as deposits or withdrawals in an account. An entry in a cash flow is positive if it comes into the pot and negative if it leaves the pot - this depends greatly on context! Cash flows can be finite or infinite.  The main tool used to understand cash flows is a timeline , which is basically an axis with tick-marks measuring time in units that are appropriate for the problem. For example, a deposit of 1000 at the end of Year 1, a deposit of 2000 at the end of Year 3, and a withdrawal of 500 at the end of Year 10 would be plotted on a timeline as follows:   An example of a timeline.      Sometimes multiple timelines may be necessary. Let us add to the above scenario a transfer of 750 into a secondary account at the end of Year 3. The combined timelines would be:   An example of how we can use multiple timelines.        Plot each of the following cash flows on a timeline.    $10,000 is deposited into an account today. After 5 years, $5,000 is withdrawn.    An heir receives $5,000 at the end of every year for the next 5 years.    $1,000 is deposited at the end of every year for the next 2 years, and is withdrawn immediately after the second deposit, and again one year after.    Joe deposits 10 today and 30 in five years. Tina will make the same two deposits, but the 10 will be deposited years from today and the 30 will be deposited 2 years from today. (Consider making two separate timelines).    The future value at time of an amount deposited at time 0 is In this equation, is the amount deposited and is the interest rate.  If the amount was not deposited at time 0, but instead at time , then the value at time is     Suppose 1000 was deposited at the end of Year 2, 2000 was deposited at the end of Year 4, and a withdrawal of is made at the end of Year 9. The balance immediately after the withdrawal is 1200. The account carries an annual interest rate of .     Plot the cash flows on a timeline.    Timeline with years from 1 to 9. Year 2 is labeled 1000, Year 4 is labeled 4000, and Year 9 is labeled -(X+1200). The accumulator is 1.03.      Calculate .         The present value is the amount that would have to be deposited now in order to generate the cash flows indicated. Unless otherwise specified, the present value is at time 0, and it can be calculated by solving the future value equation for .    An account had withdrawals of 650 at the end of years 1, 2, and 3. After the third withdrawal, the account is depleted. The present value is . The account carries an annual interest rate of .    Plot the cash flows on a timeline.    Calculate .

The account earns an annual interest rate of 5%. At the end of each year until year , the interest is withdrawn and deposited into a secondary account.  Plot the cash flows on one or more timelines.     How does a timeline help you to understand a financial scenario?   "

  "title": "Valuation",
  "body": " Valuation  In this activity, we establish the concept that is at the heart of finance: valuation. Given a cash flow and an interest rate, the value at a point in time is an equivalent, single amount at that point of time. By equivalent, we mean that investors would have no preference between the cash flow or the single value (assuming they have no need of the cash - liquidity in business terminology - throughout the time period in question). We understand investor preferences purely through investment calculations.  To understand this, let us recall how we calculate the balance in an account under compound interest. Support 300 is deposited in an account at the end of year 2, and the account earns an annual interest rate of 4%. The amount at the end of year 5 is:   On a timeline, it might look like:   Timeline for the compound interest example.      In this case, assuming no need for the cash between years 2 and 5, the investor would be equally satisfied with 300 at the end of year 2 or 337.46 at the end of year 5.  In this example, when we are looking at the value of cash flows at a later point in time, the value is called the future value or the accumulated value . The former term is not so common in actuarial science. In this book, we will use the terms interchangeably. We will also say that we are \"pushing forward\" the 300 for 3 years. This is a term borrowed from differential geometry and is not common among actuaries. So it will be our little secret.  We can also look backward in time. If we want to have 337.46 at the end of year 5, how much do we need to deposit at the end of year 2? This is the same example as above, but with the arrows reversed, so the answer is 300. It might look as follows on a timeline:   Timeline for the present value example.      When we are looking at the value at time 0, we call the result the present value . We sometimes use that term more loosely, whenever we are valuing at an earlier point in time. That is colloquial. The more formal way to describe the 300 in this example is as the value at time 2. Secretly borrowing another term from differential geometry, we will say we are \"pulling back\" the 337.46 to time 2.  So, in short, we can think of an accumulated value as the balance in an account bearing the given interest rate if the cash flows were so deposited, and a present value as the amount that would have to be deposited in order to generate the given cash flows under the given interest rate.  The point of valuation is that when we are performing calculations and crafting equations, everything in sight has to be valued at the same point in time. Each individual payment has to be pushed forward or pulled back to a common point in time before we can combine them or set anything equal. Values at points in time are like units in this way, and we should think of them as such. In a given problem, we often have considerable freedom in where we value everything. Later in this chapter we will look at some strategies for making these choices.  To model this mathematically, we need functions. The function is called the accumulation function . The interest rate will be denoted by . If an amount is deposited at time 0, then its value at time is In this case, is the present value. Notice that we are multiplying by another function. The function is called the accumulation factor . Note that if we deposit some amount at time and we have These functions tell us how to push forward. When there are several amounts involved, each has to be valued at the same point in time and added up .  In , much of this will be generalized.    Show (by direct calculation) that the interest rate is the percentage change in across 1 time period (say, between times and ).      Let us consider how to \"pull back.\" Use the equations for pushing forward above.     Solve the appropriate equation for to find an equation for the present value of . Write your result in two ways.          Solve the appropriate equation for to find an equation for pulling back to time . Write your result in two ways.           Find both the indicated future value, and the present value, for each of the following cash flows. Generate a timeline if it helps! Look for possible shortcuts!

Note that your answers will be expressions and not numbers.      You may or may not have noticed some shortcuts in how we can perform calculations. If you did not, look back at your work or discuss with a partner, and respond to the following questions.    Suppose cash flows go in and out of an account bearing an annual compound interest rate of and that the value of the cash flows at the end of year 14 is 14,300. What is the present value?    Suppose cash flows go in and out of an account bearing an annual compound interest rate of and that the present value of the cash flows is 7500. What is the value at the end of year 19?    Describe what you discovered and explain the role that the laws of exponents play in why this works.      Sometimes we value at a point in the middle of a set of cash flows. For the following exercises, make timelines if it helps organize the data!     An account bearing an annual interest rate of has deposits of 100 at the end of year 1, 200 at the end of year 2, 300 at the end of year 3, and 400 at the end of year 4.

  "title": "Problem Solving 1 -- The Financial Calculator",
  "body": " Problem Solving 1 -- The Financial Calculator    Calculator Corner   On the SOA exam, speed is an important factor. The financial calculator is indispensable. This entire activity introduces you to the financial calculator. In future activities, we will see occasional \"calculator corner\" questions that will teach us how to use the calculator to perform financial calculations. Note that you still need to know the formulas in order to succeed - the calculator is a necessary but not sufficient tool for the exam.     First, note that the financial calculator uses something called chain order of operations .    What is ? Type this into the financial calculator - what did you get? How did the calculator interpret your commands?    Use the financial calculator to calculate , using the LN key. If you get an error, try typing in the opposite order.    Use the financial calculator to calculate , using the key. If you get an error, try typing in the opposite order.    Use the financial calculator to calculate , using the key. What did you have to do in order to get the exponent to be negative?    What do you notice about the order in which you have to press the keys to evaluate functions such as an exponential or logarithmic function?      Your calculator has several variables you can define, and there are also several settings. Settings can be accessed and changed through the FORMAT key. This key is above the decimal, and you access it by typing 2ND followed by the decimal button. We will refer to these keystrokes as 2ND  FORMAT .    There are several settings, but we will focus on one for now. That is the number of decimals. You can change the decimal accuracy by pressing the number of decimals you want, followed by ENTER 2ND  QUIT . The key QUIT is above the CPT key. Change your decimal accuracy to 3. Then change it back to wherever you want it.    There are two variables that we will not deal with for some time, and they should be set to 1. Both are accessed by pressing 2ND  P\/Y (above the I\/Y key). NOTE: If you are getting a result in your calculator that seems wrong, check these two variables to see if they are defined correctly .    The first is labeled `P\/Y' and represents the number of interest periods in a year. Type the number 1 followed by the ENTER key.    The second is labeled `C\/Y' and represents how often interest is compounded in a year. To access this, press the key. Then press 1 followed by the ENTER key.      There are two other keys you should be familiar with. The key CE|C clears your screen, while the key CLR WORK clears the value of any variables you defined.      In your calculator keys, you will find a row of keys labeled N , interest , PV , PMT , and FV . These are the time value of money (TMV) keys. In addition, in the top row at the left, you will see a key labeled CPT . This is a command to compute. We use the time value of money functions by entering the values we know and then type CPT followed by the desired TMV key. Here are some notes about what these means and how to use them:    The key N is for the number of interest periods, interest is an interest rate, PV is the present value, PMT is a regular payment, and FV is the future value. We will not use the PMT key until .    Due to the chain order of operations, enter values by pressing the number followed by the relevant TVM key.     Sign convention: The calculator interprets entries as inflows and outflows, and outflows are designated with negative numbers while inflows are positive. Between the present and future value, one will be positive and one will be negative. If you do not account for this, you will get an error when you have the calculator compute interest and will get an incorrect result when computing N .    For the interest rate, you have to enter it as a percentage. So if the interest rate is 0.025, you type 2.5 followed by the interest key.    The known TVM variables can be entered in any order.    For now, each payment has to be entered separately. Later, we will be able to relax this limitation.    In between problems, you can clear out the TVM variables by typing 2ND  CLR TVM (above the FV key).    Use the calculator to solve the following problems.    Find the future value of 1500 after 7 years with an annual interest rate of 1.75%. The answer should be approximately 1693.68.    A single deposit was made into an account with an annual interest rate of 4%. After 15 years, the account has a balance of 19143.21. What was the original deposit? The answer should be approximately 10,629.54.    A deposit of 5000 grows to 5150.23 after two years. What was the interest rate? The answer should be approximately 0.0149.    Given an annual interest rate of 0.0075, how long does it take 12000 to grow to 13000? The answer should be approximately 10.7 years.      If we make a change to one (or more, but not all) values in a problem, all we have to do is re-enter the new data. You can do this even if you are computing something different! Try this in the financial calculator for the following pair of problems.    If 5150 is deposited into an account bearing 3% annual interest, what is the balance after 5 years?    Now, suppose the balance after 5 years is actually 5800. What was the original deposit? Why key strokes did you use?     Look back at and identify one problem to redo with the calculator. Which approach do you prefer - the calculator or the algebraic approach? Why?   "

  "title": "Nominal and Effective Interest Rates",
  "body": " Nominal and Effective Interest Rates  The last activity focused on one important detail: when to value our cash flows. In the next three activities, we are going to focus on another important detail: which interest rate to use. We will see that this is intimately related to our choice of units for time. The most common error is probably using an interest rate that does not match our unit of time, so we will return to this throughout the first five chapters of this book.  As a starting point, we note that we are often quoted an interest rate for a year that is intended to be divided up evenly among natural subdivisions of the year (like months or quarters). This is called a nominal interest rate. It is essentially useless in calculations. It does not tell you what interest is actually earned. The interest rate we need for all of our calculations is called a effective interest rate. The effective interest rates tell us how much interest is accrued over a period of time.   A Warning  ⚠ In calculations, only use effective rates! .   Note that if we are already using for an interest rate, and we need a different interest rate, we will use a different symbol. Often we go right to . We will see others throughout this book.  In order to make the terms nominal and effective interest rates meaningful, we begin with an illustrative and relatively simple example.    We have an account earning 12% compounded monthly (sometimes just said monthly , or convertible monthly ). This means that this 12% is split up evenly over the 12 months of the year.    What interest rate applies to a single month? This is the effective periodic rate (in this case, the effective monthly rate).    Suppose you invest $1 for a year. Sketch a timeline showing all of the interest that compounds. You can skip some months once you figure out a computational shortcut!    How much is in the account at the end of the year?    How much of that amount in the account is interest?    Express that as a percentage, which is a rate of interest for a year in this account. This is called the effective annual interest rate .    Why is your result different from the 12% annual rate we started with? (The 12% rate is called the nominal annual interest rate .)      Find the effective annual interest rate for the following nominal rates:    6%, compounded quarterly    9%, compounded monthly    12%, compounded quarterly    7.5%, compounded semiannually    Actuaries have their own notation for a nominal interest rate. An nominal interest rate compounded times per year is denoted . So, for example, in the last question you were given . The is not an exponent, it is not an operation, it is simply a designation. That is why it is in parentheses - to distinguish it from an exponent.  You can be given a nominal rate that compounds less often than once per year: would represent a nominal rate compounded every 2 years, so the 2-year effective rate is .  We can use timelines to represent when interest rates are in effect. So for the example in the first question, we have 1% per month that results in approximately 12.68% per year. We sketch a timeline as follows:   A timeline which illustrates how we use them to show when interest rates are in effect.      Observe that we uses our accumulation factors of . When we get our results, it is simple enough to lop off the leading one, and the equations are more intuitive, and follow from the timelines naturally, if we relate our accumulation factors.  More generally, if we have a nominal rate of (which, for simplicity, we will assume ), we have an effective thly rate of , and the annual effective rate is denoted , then we have the following:   Using a timeline to convert nominal interest into effective interest.        Use the timeline to find a formula for given .  Your formula can be used to find given . Even though is useless in calculations, some exam problems may ask you to answer with a nominal rate!    Given , find .    Given , find .      Mountain Bank pays interest at a rate of . River Bank pays interest compounded daily. What minimum nominal annual rate must River Bank pay in order to be as attractive as Mountain Bank? Assume a 360-day year.     🧮 Calculator Corner   We can convert between nominal and effective annual rates in the calculator. To do so, locate and select the ICONV button (it is above the button for 2, so you will need the 2ND key). You will see an option for NOM . This is where you can enter or calculate a nominal annual rate. If you press the key, you will see an option for EFF . This is where you can enter or calculate an effective annual rate. If you press once more, you will see an option for C\/Y . This is where you can enter how often interest is compounded per year.  The way this works is that you enter the two pieces of information you have (hit the ENTER key after each numerical entry), navigate to the quantity you want to calculate, and press the CPT key. All rates should be entered as percentages (i.e. 6, not .06).    Use the calculator to redo .    Use the calculator to redo .

We choose the desired interest rate by choosing units of time for the problem, which are often dictated by the timing of the cash flows.

  "body": " Multiple Interest Rates 1 -- Simultaneous Rates  Problems often have multiple interest rates. These interest rates may occur simultaneously. In other words, there may be more than one account, each with their own interest rate (which may be quoted as an annual effective rate, a periodic rate, or a nominal rate). Interest rates can also occur consecutively. For example, the interest rate on a single account may be different over different periods in time. Another example might have to do with forecasted interest rates.  In all of these cases, a timeline can help us sort out what is happening in the problem so that we can solve it.  In this activity, we examine a problem in which different interest rates occur simultaneously, and save consecutive interest rates for the next activity.  Here is an example of a problem in which multiple interest rates occur simultaneously:    Peter Parker borrows $2500 at the beginning of Year 0 with an annual effective interest rate He has to pay the balance, including interest, at the end of Year 3. He deposits $950 into an account earning a nominal interest rate at the end of Years 1, 2, and 3. At the end of Year 3, he uses the balance in his deposit account to pay off his loan (we will see in Chapter 6 that this deposit account is called a sinking fund ). How much does he have left?

During the first year, the account has an effective annual interest rate of 3%. During the second year, the account has a nominal interest rate of 9% compounded monthly.

Consecutive interest rates are useful in finding some kind of \"average interest rate\" (or \"average annual rate of compound growth\" or something similar).

Their notation can often declutter formulas, but at a price of making them more difficult to understand.  We have already met some actuarial notation. The symbol is actuarial notation for a nominal interest rate. Our next bit of actuarial notation concerns present values.  In this course, you will find that present value formulas are often more elegant than their future value equivalents. Recall that the present value is related to the future value at time (written a little differently) is The expression is called the present value factor , and by itself is clunky to work with. Actuaries use for the present value factor. In this activity, we will explore the advantage and disadvantage of this notation.    An annuity (more precisely, annuity-immediate) is a sequence of payments made at the end of each period over a length of time. We want the payments to be equally spaced, meaning the time between each payment is the same. We will denote the payment amount by (which for now we assume to be constant), and the number of payments to be . This means we have payments of at the end of times .    Generate a timeline to represent such an annuity.    Let us consider the present value at time 0.    Find the present value of the th payment. Use the present value factor written as .    Write the present value of the annuity at time 0 as a sum of the present values of each payment, using the present value factor written as .      Recall from calculus that a geometric series is a series of the form While we will review geometric series later in this book, for now we will use the following formula to sum from 1 to :     Use our geometric series formula to find a closed-form formula for the present value of an annuity. Simplify the denominator as much as possible.      Actuaries us for the present value factor: If there is more than one interest rate (like and ), we put subscripts on : and .    Rewrite the original present value formula (relating and ) using .    Prove the identity ( Hint : Directly substitute the expression for on the left and simplify.)

Annuities show up throughout this course. Here are a couple of examples.     is about loans. If someone is paying back a loan, the outstanding balance after the th payment is the present value (at time ) of the remaining payments. This is called the prospective form of the outstanding balance formula (it looks forward, prospectively, to the upcoming payments). Using for the payments, and using interest rate , find a formula for the outstanding balance after payments.    A bond involves    an equally-spaced sequence of payments of , called coupon payments, followed by    a final lump sum paid with the last coupon payment called the redemption amount .    The coupon payments use a rate called the coupon rate applied to something called the face value . So the coupon payments are (often ). The interest rate is used for valuation, and often .  The price of the bond is the present value of the coupon payments and the redemption amount. Find a formula for the price of a bond with coupon payments of , redemption amount , and interest rate .      State one advantage and one disadvantage of using for the present value factor.    "

A bond involves    an equally-spaced sequence of payments of , called coupon payments, followed by    a final lump sum paid with the last coupon payment called the redemption amount .    The coupon payments use a rate called the coupon rate applied to something called the face value . So the coupon payments are (often ). The interest rate is used for valuation, and often .  The price of the bond is the present value of the coupon payments and the redemption amount. Find a formula for the price of a bond with coupon payments of , redemption amount , and interest rate .

  "body": " Inflation and the Real Rate of Interest  So far, all of our analysis has examined interest rates in isolation. We should remember that more than dollar amounts change. If we examine inflation, we can measure growth rates in terms of purchasing power. The growth rate of purchasing power is the real rate of interest.  In the problems, you will see a problem in which taxes are also inserted into the picture.    Our first example comes directly from .  Smith invests 1000 for one year at effective annual rate 15.5%. At the time Smith makes the investment, the cost of a certain consumer good is 1. One year later, when interest is paid and principal is returned to Smith, the cost of the item has become 1.10.    How many of these consumer items can Smith afford with his initial investment?    How much is returned to Smith from his investment at the end of the year?    How many of these consumer items can Smith afford after one year?    What was the growth rate in Smith's purchasing power?      We will now codify what we did in in order to obtain formulas.    Repeat but with an investment of 1.    Inflation grows at a percentage rate in the same way that investments grow at at a percentage rate . We denote the real rate of interest -- the percentage change in purchasing power -- by .  Mimic your work in to find a formula for in terms of and .    While ordinarily we have found it useful to leave our formulas in terms of , we will go a little further here. Solve your formula for and simplify so that you have a single rational expression.      Suppose that for the coming year inflation is forecast at an effective annual rate of and interest is forecast at an effective annual rate . What will be the corresponding real, inflation-adjusted rate of interest for the coming year?      What do you notice from the last problem?    "

  "body": " Ethics Case Study: Pawn Shops  A person who owns something valuable and needs money quickly might get that money by pawning their valuable item. They would take it to a pawnbroker , who would hold their item as collateral and give them a loan. After some fixed period of time (usually 90 days), if the borrower does not repay the loan with interest, the pawnbroker may sell the item and keep the proceeds.  This industry is regulated on a state-by-state basis. At the time of this writing, 41 states cap the interest rate a borrower may be charged. These rates range from 0.5% to 30%, and the average rate is roughly 11.8%.    Before we start, read about the six ethical lenses published by the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University . Which lens(es) do you think you will bring to this analysis?    Let's start by looking at the information on two websites. The first is from the website of the National Pawnbrokers Association and explains how a pawn transaction works . What responsibilities does the pawnbroker have, and what actions might the person pawning the item take?    The second is from the Federal Reserve and deals with the way Americans bank and use credit . The most relevant section is \"Nonbank Small Dollar Credit.\" Give an example of a situation where someone might choose to use a pawn shop.      Think of an item someone might choose to pawn: perhaps electronics, sports equipment, or designer bags. (Please don't choose a precious metal or a weapon: pawning those items is highly regulated.)    What would the price of that item be if it were bought new?    In general, a pawnbroker will assume they can resell an item for 60% of the new price and that they should lend one third of that resale price. How much would the pawnbroker think they could resell the above item for, and how much would they lend someone who gave them this item as collateral?    Suppose the borrower doesn't redeem the item and the pawnbroker takes possession of it after 90 days. What is the implicit interest rate that the pawnbroker gets from this transaction?    Now suppose the borrower pays this average interest rate of 11.8% every 30 days. If the interest is compounded, how many 30-day periods will it take before the cost of redeeming the item is equal to the amount the pawnbroker expects to sell it for?    What other, nonfinancial cost might the borrower experience even if they do redeem their item?      Let’s do a stakeholder analysis. In this scenario, the stakeholders are the borrower and the pawnbroker. Try to see the situation through the eyes of both of them.  Test your options by determining how the stakeholders you identified could be harmed or benefited in this kind of transaction. Fill in the following table:     Stakeholder  Harms  Benefits                       Finally, reflect on your decision. What was the nature of your justification? Look back at the ethical lenses from Santa Clara University. Which lens(es) best fit your list of harms and benefits? Was that the same or different from your opinion at the beginning of this activity? Does that surprise you? Why or why not?    "

Let's consider the mathematical benefits of linearity. Suppose $1000 is invested in an account with a 12% annual simple interest rate.    What is the balance in the account after 1 month? Comparing that balance to the original investment of 1000, what is the monthly simple interest rate?    What is the balance in the account after 3 months? Comparing that balance to the original investment of 1000, what is the quarterly simple interest rate?    What is the balance in the account after 6 months? Comparing that balance to the original investment of 1000, what is the semiannual simple interest rate?    What is the two-month simple interest rate?    What do you notice? What role does linearity play? What is a mathematical benefit of linearity?      Simple interest is often used to value accounts between interest compounding periods. For example, if interest compounded monthly, and we wanted to value after 3 months and 12 days, we would value using the effective monthly compound rate for the 3 months, and use a simple interest approximation for the 12 days.    This problem is modified from . Suppose an account has an effective annual interest rate of 12%. Simple interest (also at 12%) is applied to fractions of a year. Calculate the number of years (including fractions) it will take for an investment of 1000 to accumulate to 3000.    Why might we use simple interest as an approximation for fractions of an interest period?      Try to solve the following in two different ways, and explain what is going on. This illustrates the limitations of linearity.  A deposit of 7800 is made on day 39 of a year, and another deposit of 5150 is made on day 57 of the same year. The account has an annual simple interest rate of 4%. Find the account balance half-way through the year (assume a 360-day year).      FM Exam problems often mix compound interest and simple interest. Solve the following, which is from a former exam:  Joe deposits 10 today and another 30 in five years into a fund paying simple interest of 11% per year. Tina will make the same deposits, but the 10 will be deposited years from today and the 30 will be deposited years from today. Tina's deposits earn an effective annual rate of 9.15%. At the end of 10 years, the accumulated amount of Tina's deposits equals the accumulated amount of Joe's deposits. Calculate .      Two interest rate structures are equivalent if they yield the same values at all of the same times. Why would a simple interest rate structure never be equivalent to a compound interest rate structure? Illustrate with an example.

  "title": "Introduction to Discount",
  "body": " Introduction to Discount  So far, we have assumed interest is paid at the end of each period. This is called interest payable in arrears . Sometimes interest is paid at the beginning of a period, called interest payable in advance . In this case, we call the rate that is used the discount rate and denote it with the variable .   ⚠ You should be aware that actuaries use the term discount in the precise sense that we will explore over the next several activities. In business and finance, you will hear discount rate and interest rate used interchangeably. The word discount in that sense is used when using an interest rate to find the present value , said to be \"discounting to present value\" (as the present value is less than the accumulated value).     Let's start with a simple example from . Suppose Lita Ford borrows 1000 for one year with 10% interest payable in advance.    The way this works is that the interest is taken out of 1000 and the borrower gets the remainder. What is left? This is .    At the end of the year, Lita has to pay back what was borrowed, both the amount she got and the interest taken out. How much is this? This is .    The discount rate comes from the following equation: Calculate Lita Ford's discount rate. What do you notice?    The formula for is for an effective discount rate (we will meet the nominal versions later). If time is in years, this is an effective annual discount rate. If time is measured in months, this is an effective monthly discount rate.    For each of the following, find the effective annual discount rate .     and      and      and       In , we noted that exponential functions are characterized by a constant percentage change. With an effective interest rate , we had and was this percentage rate of change. The base is .    Compare and contrast the formula for and the formula for . What do you notice?    I like to say that discount is a backwards-looking percentage change. What do I mean by this?    Let's figure out how we can calculate present and future values when we are given a discount rate . The following version of an interest rate timeline has the arrows pointing \"backwards\" to emphasize the backward-looking nature of the percentage change we are working with.   Illustration of the interest and discount rate on a timeline        We begin with present value. Suppose we have an amount at time and we would like to know .     Looking backwards, from to , do you expect percentage increase or decrease? Why?    We should have a percentage decrease, since there is less money in the account before interest has accumulated over that year.      Since is the constant percentage change, and is written as a positive percentage, what is the base of our exponential function?         How many factors of our base do we need to multiply by to get back to ?    To go from to , we need to multiply by factors.      Use your answers to write a formula for given and an effective discount rate .          Solve your formula for . This will give us a formula for future value using discount. Typically this formula is written using negative exponents.         Solve the following exercises using discount. Assume time is in years unless otherwise indicated.    What is the present value of 150 at time and 450 at time at an effective annual discount rate ?    If 250 is deposited every year for 3 years in an account with an effective annual discount rate of , what is the balance one year after the last deposit?     If 4521.79 is the present value of 6000 at time (in years), find the effective annual discount rate .         Using an effective annual discount rate , a deposit of 7500 grows to 7990.05 after years. Find .      Which is simpler to work with when you have discount, present or future value? Why? How might that impact your problem solving strategy?     🖩 Calculator Corner  To use the financial calculator to find present and future values with discount, we \"trick it\" into performing these calculations.     Starting with present value, let's say we want to find the present value of 1000 in 4 years with an effective rate of . The answer is 885.29.    To get the calculator to perform this calculation, type 1000 FV 3 ±  I\/Y 4 ±  N  CPT  PV .    Explain why this works.    Adapt to find the future value of 1250 after 5 years with an effective discount rate of 2%. The answer should be 1382.86. Write your keystrokes.    We conclude by putting some things together to solve a problem.    Salt deposits into an account bearing effective annual interest rate of 3%. At the same time, Peppa deposits into an account with effective annual discount rate of 4.5%. The balance in Salt's account after years is equal to the balance in Peppa's account after years. Calculate .

There are two limitations we have to work with. As we noted in , nominal rates are useless for calculations. So the first limitation is that we cannot perform rate conversions using nominal rates. Secondly, our conversion formulas between discount and interest will return a rate with the same period as the original rate. If we convert an effective monthly discount rate to an interest rate, the result will be an effective monthly interest rate. What this means is that in conversions, we first need an effective rate, then we convert, then we adjust to get the rate we need.    Convert as indicated.

In addition to being useful in its own right, continuous compounding can be used an approximation when interest compounds at a high frequency (such as daily).  Figuring out how to perform calculations with continuous compounding requires limits. We will need to make use of L'HĮpital's Rule. This tells us that if the limit of a quotient of functions is indeterminate: then the limit is equal to the limit of the quotient of the derivatives (if it exists):   Sometimes this has to be iterated multiple times before we get a limit.    Recall that is the nominal interest rate compounded times per year. Let denote the equivalent interest rate compounded continuously. Why is ?      The limit above will require L'Hôpital's Rule. Let us practice using this rule with a few exercises. Evaluate the following limits. Note that some will require the use of the rule more than once!                        There are other indeterminate forms for which L'Hôpital's Rule applies. The simplest way to attack these is to rewrite them as a quotient. For simplicity, we will only look at the case, as that is what we will need to apply.    Evaluate the following limits.                Now we will derive our equation for .

More generally, this equation holds if is an effective rate and is an interest rate continuously compounded over the same period.  We also have the following future and present value formulas:    We will use these to solve problems involving continuously compounded interest.   ⚠ It is important to be flexible with the choice of symbols and notation, and use context to understand what is intended. We sometimes use for a continuously compounded interest rate. But we have also used for an inflation rate, and later in this book we will use for a constant percentage change in payments. In addition, by the end of this chapter, we will generally use instead of for a continuously compounded interest rate. This is the most common choice of symbols for the FM exam. However, for the IFM exam, you will see return for a continuously compounded interest rate, and will indicate continuously payable dividends on a stock that are assumed to be reinvested in the stock. So be sure to read carefully to make sure you know how a given symbol is used in a problem.     Convert as indicated.

In the IFM exam, you will have to find the present or future value of a sequence of dividends, and it will be important to carefully read the type of interest rate given.

We define the force of interest in terms of a given accumulation function : One way to understand what this means is in terms of instantaneous change. When you learned about derivatives, you learned that the value of the derivative was the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a point. More accurately, the derivative at a point tells you the instantaneous absolute rate of change. The derivative given by the force of interest at a point tells you the instantaneous percentage rate of change in the accumulation function at the point.  In this activity, we will assume we are given the accumulation function and find the force of interest. In the next activity, we will invert this process.

We aren't going to do this rigorously. Rather, we will use the general principal that as we go from discrete to continuous, we have .   ⚠ Warning  One note about notation -- we are going to start seeing raised to complicated exponents. It is customary to use in these situations. In other words, .     We'll start with a simple example. Suppose 1 is invested in an account that has an annual continuously compounded interest rate of 5% during the first year, 3.5% during the second year, and 6% during the third year.

Find the force of interest (don't overthink this!).     ⚠ Warning  As we will see, it turns out that having a continuously compounding interest rate of over a period is equivalent to having a constant force of interest over the period, and . For the rest of this book, unless otherwise indicated, we will use for our continuously compounded interest rates (as well as a constant force of interest).

  "body": " Problem Solving 3 -- Multiple Forms of Interest Accumulation  You will encounter problems that involve a variety of forms of interest accumulation occurring consecutively. In this activity, we will work through some examples. There is no new mathematics or finance in this activity, it will serve as a review of the first two chapters before we dive into the wide world of annuities.    We start by listing all of the forms of interest accumulation we have learned.    List all forms of interest accumulation that we have seen that are equivalent to compound interest.    List all other forms of interest accumulation we have seen (those that are not equivalent to compound interest).      The following exercise involves multiple forms of accumulation that are equivalent to compound interest. There are two ways of solving this: we can push forward with appropriate accumulation factors for each time period, or we can convert all rates to a common form and push forward using those equivalent rates.    First, solve the problem:  The amount 1075 is deposited into an account at time . For the first two years, the account accumulates interest at a rate . During the next two years, the account accumulates discount at an effective annual rate . For the following three years, discount accumulates at a rate Then the account accumulates interest at an effective annual interest rate of for three years, followed by 5 years with a force of interest . Find the future value.    Which approach did you take to solving the problem? Did you use the original accumulation factors or did you convert to a common form of interest accumulation? What were the advantages and disadvantages?      Sometimes we may have two or more nonequivalent forms of interest accumulation.

The accumulated balance in the fund at the end of 30 years is 100. Calculate .      Let us conclude by reviewing some formulas. First, we will review present and future value formulas.     Fill in the following table with accumulation factors:       Future Value  Present Value    Simple Interest           Effective Compound Interest           Effective Compound Discount           Constant force of interest           Non-constant force of interest                   Future Value  Present Value    Simple Interest           Effective Compound Interest           Effective Compound Discount           Constant force of interest           Non-constant force of interest               For those that are equivalent, write two equations: one equating all of the equivalent accumulation factors and one equating all of the equivalent present value factors. These are called \"all-in-one\" equations.    Which of these formulas do you feel you need to memorize, and which can you figure out from first principles?      Finally we review conversion formulas for forms of interest equivalent to compound interest.    Fill in the following table, assuming you are given the information described in each row and want to convert to the rate described in each column, and each rate is effective.

Generational wealth can lead to the accumulation of privilege, as children of wealthier families have more access to education and jobs - for example, children from wealthy families tend to do better on the SAT test .  Generational wealth can be looked at through the lens of time-value of money. If an asset increases in value then its future value will be greater than its present value. For example, a home purchased in 1985 will be worth more (in the sense of future value) than one purchased for the same price today.  In this activity, we'll look at how generational wealth accumulates from home ownership, and discuss the ethical impact of programs that seek to increase home ownership and build generational wealth.    While the value of a home does generally tend to increase, it does not do so at a fixed rate like the other investments we have seen. Instead, the rate at which the value increases tends to vary from month to month.  The table below gives the monthly percentage change in the Case-Schiller index, which measures the price of existing homes, during 2024:     Month  % Change    01\/24  -0.04    02\/24  0.62    03\/24  1.34    04\/24  1.24    05\/24  0.92    06\/24  0.48    07\/24  0.10    08\/24  -0.17    09\/24  -0.11    10\/24  -0.21    11\/24  -0.09    12\/24  -0.12       Calculate the effective annual rate of increase in the value of a home over 2024, by taking these monthly effective rates and finding the equivalent effective annual rate .    Calculate the effective monthly rate of increase which is equivalent to the effective annual rate .    When averaging any kind of multiplicative percentage, we use the geometric mean instead of the arithmetic mean we're used to. The geometric mean consists of taking the product of terms and then finding the th root. Let the be the monthly percentage changes. Show that the geometric mean of the      Let's look at how the value of a home increases over generations. This is an example of a force of interest problem, since the rate is fluctuating constantly. However, since we have data values instead of a function, we will do the calculation using numerical methods in a program like Excel or in a programming language like Python.    The Case-Schiller price change spreadsheet gives the monthly change in home prices from January 1987 through September 2025.    Use the spreadsheet to calculate the value in September 2025 of a house purchased in January 1987 for $80,000.  Use the spreadsheet to calculate the value in September 2025 of a house purchased in January 2007 for $80,000.      You are working for a nonprofit which seeks to increase generational wealth in communities which have traditionally not had access to homeownership or other investments to grow generational wealth. Create a list of 5 strategies for growing generational wealth which could be accessible to individuals with a range of incomes.  Create a presentation which you could deliver to a community organization about helping individuals create generational wealth.    "

  "body": " Arbitrage  Before we get into valuing annuities, there are couple of preliminaries. In this activity, we focus on understanding why the present value of a cash stream is the same as the price of the cash stream.   Arbitrage is a risk-free profit. The \"no-arbitrage\" rule says that arbitrage is not possible, or perhaps more to the point arbitrage should not occur. This is a fundamental axiom underlying all of finance. At the end of this chapter, we will explore the role arbitrage plays in ethical matters.  Our purpose in this activity is simply to understand why present values are used as prices of cash flows. You will spend much more time thinking about arbitrage when you prepare for the IFM exam.    Let's start with a simple example. Suppose you can purchase or sell the right to be paid 1000 two years from now, and the effective annual interest rate is 5%. Assume that you can also borrow or lend at the effective annual interest rate.    What is the present value? Your answer should be larger than 850 and lower than 950.    Suppose this is priced at 950. How could you exploit this and earn an arbitrage profit? What would that profit be at the end of two years?    Suppose this is priced at 850. How could you exploit this and earn an arbitrage profit? What would that profit be at the end of two years?      Now let's make this a little more complicated. Valued at an effective interest rate of 2.5%, the present value of an annuity making 10 payments at the end of each year of 150 is 1312.81. We will see later that if the present value were larger, the payments would be larger, while if the present value were lower, the payments would be lower. Assume you can purchase or sell the annuity at its price, and can borrow or lend at the effective interest rate.    Suppose this is priced at 1200. How could you exploit this and earn an arbitrage profit? (You do not have to calculate the profit).    Suppose this annuity is priced at 1400. How could you exploit this and earn an arbitrage profit? (You do not have to calculate the profit).      We conclude with loans. Use arbitrage to explain why the amount loaned to a borrower (called, simply enough, the loan amount ) is the present value of the payments.    "

We have the geometric series formula that tells us the sum:   Notice that the sum starts at 0. What if we want to sum something like the following?   Since that sum does not start at 0, we have to make some modifications. This will be useful for probability as well as finance.    We can start by summing a few basic geometric series. Find the sum of each of the following:                     Now suppose we want to start at some value of the index besides 0.

  "title": "Introduction to Annuities-Immediate",
  "body": " Introduction to Annuities-Immediate  Now that we have covered the preliminaries, we begin our study of annuities, starting with annuities immediate.  An annuity immediate is a finite series of periodic payments where the payments are made at the end of each period. A perpetuity immediate is an infinite series of periodic payments where the payments are made at the end of each period. We will assume the following:    The payments are all the same amount.    The interest rate is constant.    The periods are the same length.    The payments will definitely be made.    We will relax some of these assumptions later. The last assumption says that our annuities are \"annuities certain\" (as opposed to \"contingent annuities\" where the payments may or may not take place). We will only deal with annuities-certain in this course, but you will see annuities-contingent in preparation for later actuarial exams.  What follows are problems, some of which are former exam problems. We are only going to analyze the problems -- over the next few activities, we will build the machinery to solve them!    To accumulate 8000 at the end of 3 years, deposits of 98 are made at the end of each of the first years and 196 at the end of each of the next 2 years. The effective annual rate of interest is .

In this activity, we will meet annuities due - annuities where the payments occur at the beginning of each period. There are also perpetuities due which is analogous.  What follows are problems, some of which are former exam problems. As with annuities immediate, we are only going to analyze the problems -- over the next few sections, we will build the machinery to solve them.    Chuck needs to purchase an item in 10 years. The item costs 200 today, but its price inflates 4% per year. To finance the purchase, Chuck deposits 20 into an account at the beginning of each year for 6 years. He deposits an additional at the beginning of years 4, 5, and 6 to meet his goal. The effective annual interest rate is 10%. Calculate .

Make a timeline with payments of at times 1 through , and mark where , , , and belong.      For each of the following, find the desired value using the timeline relationships.    Suppose . Find .

Darth Vader borrows 25,000 at an effective monthly rate of 4% so he can make upgrades to his suit. He repays the loans with payments of 1350 at the end of each month.

When a loan arrangement is such that the payoff time is not a whole number, there are two options. The first option is a balloon payment . Under this option, an amount is added to the last regular payment in order to pay off the loan. This means that the last payment will be larger than all of the other payments. If Vader made a balloon payment at the end of the loan, how much would it be for?    The second option is a drop payment - a final payment one period after the last regular payment. A drop payment is smaller than the regular payment. Note that the balance unpaid after the last regular payment accrues interest, and that interest is included in the drop payment.

  "title": "Ethics Case Study -- Arbitrage and Insider Trading",
  "body": " Ethics Case Study -- Arbitrage and Insider Trading  Recall that arbitrage is a risk-free profit. Note that we factor the time-value of money in our understanding of profit. At the beginning of this chapter, we saw how an assumption that there is no arbitrage is used to value annuities. Later in this book, and in later courses, you will see that an assumption that there is no arbitrage is used to price cash flows and other forms of investments. The assumption that there is no arbitrage is considered reasonable, as if an arbitrage opportunity arises the market will adapt.    According to Timothy Johnson, the assumption that there is no arbitrage is taken to be an ethical principle. Explain -- why would the presence of arbitrage be an ethical problem?    One of the ways one can find an arbitrage opportunity is by obtaining inside information . This is sometimes legal and sometimes illegal, and insider trading laws are enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission. While not defined by statute, the courts describe insider trading as \"purchasing or selling a security while in possession of material, non-public information concerning that security, where the information is obtained from a breach of fiduciary duty, or a duty arising from a relationship of trust or confidence.\"  One can imagine trading based on stolen inside information as an illegal activity.  In the movie Trading Places , the heroes get revenge on the antagonists by co-opting the antagonists' insider trading scheme, engaging in insider trading themselves, and make a great deal of money while bankrupting the antagonists. While the audience feels some satisfaction, the heroes actually engaged in insider trading.  Suppose you are an SEC prosecutor, and you have to decide whether to prosecute the heroes in this case. There is room to exercise prosecutorial discretion. Keep in mind that the underlying ethical principal is the no arbitrage assumption.     Step 1 : State the problem.    The heroes of the movie are Louis Winthorp III and Billy Ray Valentine. Louis is a wealthy managing director at an investment brokerage owned by the antagonists, the Duke brothers, and Billie Ray is a homeless beggar. Louis is played by Dan Akroyd and Billie Ray is played by Eddie Murphy.  The Duke brothers are debating whether nature or nurture has a greater impact on whether a person is successful (materially). To resolve the debate, they engage in an experiment where they arrange to switch Louis and Billie Ray. The brothers actually bet over the outcome. They frame Louis for theft, and plant illegal drugs on him. He gets arrested, loses his job, loses his house, his money, and his fiance. He ends up moving in with a prostitute. The Dukes then hire Billie Ray and provide him with a home, a servant, a job in their firm (with training), a car, clothes, etc. Louis ends up trying to rob the Duke's firm, while Billie Ray ends up successfully managing the firm. This leads the Dukes to determine the experiment was a success, and the bet is paid up (for one dollar!).  Billie Ray overhears the Duke brothers discussing the experiment (and making racist comments). He tracks Louis down and explains what happened. The two of them team up to get revenge by making themselves wealthy while making the Duke brothers poor.  Their plan involves a secret USDA crop report, projecting orange crop yields for the coming season. The Duke brothers have hired someone to steal a copy of the crop report in order to take over the \"frozen concentrated orange juice\" commodity market. Louis and Billie Ray find out about this, and decide that they are going to steal the actual crop report and switch it with a fake crop report that contains the opposite results. The conclusion of the actual report is that the crop yields should be normal, while the fake report concludes that the cold weather will reduce the crop yields. This is important, because if crop yields reduce, the supply curve shifts and makes frozen concentrated orange juice more expensive on the commodity market.     Step 2 : Gather the facts. Louis and Billie Ray use the real crop report to get rich and the fake crop report leads the Duke brothers to lose their money by trading in Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice futures (futures are standardized and trade-able contracts to buy or sell something at a fixed price at a fixed time in the future). Part of their plan involves \"short-selling\" futures. If the typical way to make a profit on a commodity or stock market is by buying low and then selling high (this is called \"going long\"), then short selling is the opposite: sell high first, then buy low (to \"cover the position\").  Watch the following two videos and answer the questions that follow.   End of the movie Trading Places . Some strong language.     An explanation of the end of Trading Places . Some strong language.      Explain how Louis and Billie Ray created an arbitrage opportunity.    Explain the role insider trading played in the creation of the arbitrage opportunity.    Why might the audience typically think that their action is justified?       Step 3 : Identify stakeholders. Consider both primary stakeholders (directly affected) and secondary stakeholders (indirectly affected). Try to see the situation through the eyes of all possible stakeholders.       Step 4 : Develop options. Be imaginative, avoid dilemmas or yes\/no situations. Instead consider how to modify questions and ask “to\/for whom” or “how much.\"       Step 5 : Test options by determining how the stakeholders you identified are harmed or benefited by an action or inaction. Test at least two options by filling in the following tables. You can add rows for more stakeholders, and make additional tables for more options.   Option 1 :     Stakeholder  Primary or Secondary?  Harms  Benefits                            Step 6 : Make a decision.       Step 7 : Check your work! Make sure your decision follows your gut instincts and your internal principles.      Write a memo to a superior in the SEC prosecutor recommending action. Be sure to support your position and address counterarguments (see outline in ).    "

  "title": "Ethics Case Study -- Payday Loan Apps",
  "body": " Ethics Case Study -- Payday Loan Apps   Payday loans are short-term loans that are designed to be paid back after receiving a paycheck. Typically the loan is to be paid back after two weeks. To get around usury laws, or at least to disguise the interest rate they are charging, lenders call the interest on these loans a \"fee\". As we will see, these fees correspond to very high interest rates.  Several states either strictly regulate or ban storefront payday lending. Lenders have started getting around these laws using smartphone apps (such as Money Lion). The Center for Responsible Lending ( ) issued a report with several policy recommendations. We will examine these recommendations using an ethical reasoning framework. In this activity, we will specifically work on Ethical Reasoning KSAs 1 (prerequisite knowledge - stakeholder analysis), 2(select a decision-making framework), 4 (evaluate alternative actions), and 5 (make\/justify a decision).    Before we start, read about the six ethical lenses published by the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University . Which lens(es) do you think you will bring to this analysis?  Read the Center for Responsible Lending's report on payday lending apps .  It might help you to explore an example for a lender like Money Lion. If you do so, consider using Incognito Mode or the equivalent for your browser (if you don't know what that means, please ask your instructor).  What are some of the ways payday lending apps charge interest? What do they call these charges? What is your initial reaction?      Let's look at an example. All-Star was a storefront payday lender in Big Rapids, Manistee, and Rockford (all in Michigan). The spreadsheet shows the amounts that they would loan (increments of 50) and the fees that they charged for 2 week loans.    For each loan amount, determine the effective 2-week interest rate charged.    For each loan amount, determine the effective annual interest rate charged. Remember that these are 2-week loans.    Borrowers often take out payday loans to cover an unexpected car repair, a medical debt, a tuition payment to unlock a registration hold, or even just to get through to the end of the month. What happens if they get to the end of the two weeks and can't pay the loan back? What do you think the Center for Responsible Lending means by a \"cycle of debt\"?    Let's take a loan of 50 with a fee of 7.99. Suppose a borrower has an initial loan of 50, and every two weeks borrows another 50 to pay back the previous loan, and incurs another fee of 7.99. Suppose after 2-week periods (or weeks), the borrower is able to discharge the debt of 50 once and for all.  Assume a 4% market rate of interest. Find a function for the present value of all of the interest (i.e. fees) that they paid as a function of . Alternatively, this is the amount that the lender makes on the original loan of 50.    Graph this function in Desmos. What do you notice? What is your initial reaction to what you just determined?      You are on the staff of a state representative in a jurisdiction that currently does not regulate payday lending apps. Select one or more of the recommendations for payday lending apps given in the Center for Responsible Lending's report for consideration and analysis.      Let's do a stakeholder analysis. Make a list of all those who would be impacted by implementing the recommendation(s) you are considering. Include both primary stakeholders (directly affected) and secondary stakeholders (indirectly affected). Try to see the situation through the eyes of all possible stakeholders.  Test your options by determining how the stakeholders you identified are harmed or benefited by implementing or not implementing the recommendation. Test options by filling in the following tables. You can add rows for more stakeholders, and make additional tables for more options.   Option 1 :     Stakeholder  Primary or Secondary?  Harms  Benefits                           Make a decision: write a memo to the representative you work for recommending adopting or not adopting the provision(s) you considered. You can make modifications to what the Center for Responsible Lending recommended. State your recommendation first, then justify your decision with explicit reference to the stakeholder analysis.      Finally, reflect on your decision. What was the nature of your justification? Look back at the ethical lenses from Santa Clara University. Which lens(es) best fit your recommendation? Was that the same or different from what you identified at the beginning of this activity? Does that surprise you? Why or why not? Write a brief paragraph responding to these questions and include it with your memo.    "

As needed, calculate the future or present value, then hit either the PV or FV button (depending on if you are pulling back or pushing forward), make PMT 0, and change the value for N . If needed, you may also have to change I\/Y if the rate changes (although we will deal more with that in ).

  "body": " Chunking  So far, we have assumed that the payments and the interest rates were the same throughout the lifetime of an annuity. We can relax those assumptions in various ways. One way we can do so is to assume a small, finite number of different payments. We can also assume a small, finite number of different (consecutive) interest rates. Usually small, finite means 2 (possibly 3).  To handle these examples, we can break our payments into more than 1 annuity, where each annuity has a constant payment and a constant interest rate. I sometimes refer to this approach as \"chunking\" (breaking the cash flows into \"chunks\" - separate annuities).   🧮 Calculator Tip  I typically use the financial calculator to value each \"chunk\" at an appropriate time, and type them immediately into my other calculator (with appropriate operations) as I get them, keeping all decimal places for accuracy.     We start by analyzing and solving a problem.  A loan of 10,000 is being repaid in 10 semiannual payments, with the first payment made one-half year after the loan. The first five payments are each, and the final five payments are each. What is if ?    Identify two or more annuities in this problem.    Sketch a timeline for this problem including all annuities (separated out), the original 10,000 loan, and where you want to value everything.

  "body": " Problem Solving 4 -- Multi-Step Problems and Leverage Variables  Some problems require you to calculate one or more intermediate values before solving the problem at hand. Sometimes the equation of value in these problems is actually a system of equations, other times you can write one equation and eliminate some unknowns. There is often one value which, while not the answer, is critical to solving the problem. I call this the leverage variable .   🧮 Calculator Tip:  Sometimes you can solve for the leverage variable in the financial calculator, assign it to a different TMV category, re-enter the rest of the TMV data, and solve for the value that is called for in the problem.     10,000 can be invested under two options:  OPTION 1: Deposit the 10,000 into a fund earning an effective annual rate of ; or  OPTION 2: Purchase an annuity-immediate with 24 level annual payments at an effective annual rate of 10%. The payments are deposited into a fund earning an effective annual rate of 5%.  Both options produce the same accumulated value at the end of 24 years. Calculate .    Start with the endgame of the problem: what equation do you need to solve in order to solve the problem?    What value do you need to solve your equation? This is the leverage variable .    What information in the problem will help you find the value of the leverage variable? Use that information to set up an equation for the leverage variable.    Solve the problem.      Since financial mathematics involves exponential functions, you sometimes need to solve a system of exponential equations (something you likely have not seen in your earlier problems). Let us consider an example of a system of exponential equations that we would like to solve:      When you solve systems of linear equations, you can add or subtract the two equations in order to eliminate a variable. What can you do with this exponential system in order to eliminate one of the variables? (This is the only difference in strategy!)    Use your observation about elimination to solve this system (round answers to the nearest whole number, for simplicity).      Dottie receives payments of at the end of each year for years.

  "title": "Problem Solving 6 -- Watch the Details!",
  "body": " Problem Solving 6 -- Watch the Details!  As you may have noticed, successful problem solving involves both strategy and attention to detail. We have focused by and large on strategy, so in this activity we will look at details. Our focus will be on two examples of details to pay attention to -- counting (for the period of an annuity) and the interest rate given or asked for.  We will start with counting payments. Counting sounds trivial, but if you have or plan on taking Discrete Mathematics or Combinatorics, you will find that counting can be quite involved! In our case, we will need to count the number of payments in an annuity between two dates. Here are a couple of principles:    PRINCIPAL 1: THE NUMBER OF YEARS. To count the number of years of payments, subtract, and then check if you need to add 1 or not. If payments were made during the year that was subtracted, you will have to add 1 (why?). So, for example, if semiannual payments were made, starting in January 2001 and ending with a payment in July of 2005, then there were 5 years of payments made. This is because 2005 - 2001 = 4, but this only counts payments in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005. We need to add 1 back to account for payments in 2001.    PRINCIPAL 2: TOTAL NUMBER OF PAYMENTS. Sometimes the total number of payments will be the number of payments per year times the number of years, but not always. Continuing our example, if the first semiannual payment was made on January 31, 2001 and the last was made on July 31, 2005, then we have 2 payments per year for 5 years, for a total of 10 payments. However, if the last payment was on January 31, 2005, there would be one fewer payments, so you would have 9 payments.    If you prefer, instead of working with the principals outlined above, you can also just count payments for the first couple of years, and use the example to determine how you would count more generally.    Let's work with an example problem. In counting the number of payments, you can apply the principals or generate examples from which you can extrapolate.  In December of 2019, the Joker and his goons rob a mob bank and steal . The Joker then kills his goons and takes all of for himself. On December 31, 2019, he uses to buy an annuity paying out 3 million monthly, starting on January 31, 2020. The last payment is on December 31, 2034. The annuity is valued using an effective monthly rate of . Calculate .      Let's try another problem.  A sum of 10,000 was invested on September 1, 1970 at an effective annual interest rate of 5% in order to provide an annual scholarship of 2000 every September 1, forever, starting as soon as possible. In what year will the first payment of 2000 be made? What smaller payment could be made one year earlier while still permitting the annual scholarships of 2000 thereafter? Assume that interest is credited every August 31.    The other detail we will consider comes from the rates we are given. We need to pay attention to the type of rate we are given (is it interest? discount? a force of interest?) as well as compounding frequency. We will look closer at this in the next two activities, so the problems that we will discuss in this activity give us a taste of what to look for.    An annuity-immediate that pays 400 quarterly for the next 10 years costs 10,000. Calculate the nominal interest rate convertible monthly earned by this investment.      Jerry will make deposits of 450 at the end of each quarter for 10 years. At the end of 15 years, Jerry will use the fund to make annual payments of at the beginning of each year for 4 years, after which the fund is exhausted. The effective annual rate of interest is 7%. Determine .      Make a list of details that you have to pay attention to when solving problems. Include the details we discussed in this activity, but also include details that we have encountered that we did not discuss directly.    "

  "body": " Problem Solving 7 -- Different Interest and Payment Periods  Sometimes the frequency of payments and the compounding frequency do not match. For example, you may have monthly payments but an effective annual interest rate. We cannot change the payment structure, but we can convert to an equivalent interest rate and solve from there. When solving problems in these cases, it is helpful to first identify the interest rate you are given and then the interest rate you need.  Some find direct conversion helpful. Others like to keep things exact until the end of the problem. If you do the latter, observe how the laws of exponents help with the numerators of our annuity formulas.   🧮 Calculator Tip  When I convert to equivalent interest rates, I perform the calculation for in my financial calculator, subtract 1 to get , and multiply by 100 to get the result in percentage form. Then I hit I\/Y and proceed as needed.    🧮 Calculator Tip  Some like to use the options in the P\/Y menu in the calculator (found by hitting 2ND and then I\/Y ) helpful. Then for the term, you have to type the number of years followed by xP\/Y ( 2ND followed by N ) and then N . Most students I have taught have found this confusing.

  "title": "Ethics Case Study: Student Loans",
  "body": " Ethics Case Study: Student Loans  When the National Defense Education Act established federal student loans in 1958, it included a percentage reduction in a borrower's loan for each year they spent teaching. Since then, multiple policies to ease the burden of student loans have been discussed and implemented, including loan forgiveness and subsidizing the interest on each loan.  The ethics of student loans has been debated for as long as they have been offered. Some people argue that you should pay back what you borrow; others argue that steps should be taken to make sure student loans are not unduly burdensome. In this activity, we'll explore the ethics of subsidizing student loan interest.    Before we start, read about the six ethical lenses published by the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University . Which lens(es) do you think you will bring to this analysis?    Read about the student debt burden at the Federal Reserve's website . Which statistic (or statistics) surprises you the most?    Read about the types of federal student loans at studentaid.gov . What is the difference between a Direct Subsidized Loan and a Direct Unsubsidized Loan? What is your initial assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of each for the borrower?      Let's look at an example. Student A takes out the maximum in Direct Subsidized Loans each year for four years: $3,500, $4,500, $5,500, and $5,500. Student B takes out equivalent amounts in Direct Unsubsidized Loans.  The rate as of this writing is 6.39% effective annual for the life of the loan, compounded monthly. For simplicity, let's assume that the same interest rate applies to each of the four loans taken out by each student.    Create a timeline for the loan disbursements for each student through June 1 at the end of their fourth year of college; assume each of them receives the disbursement on September 1 of the relevant year and that the student with the unsubsidized loan *capitalizes* their interest by rolling their interest payments into the principal.    Determine the accumulated value of each of their loans on June 1 of the end of their fourth year of college.    Assume each borrower agrees to a 15-year repayment plan on that day. How much will each one owe each month?    Now assume that each of Student A and B enroll in a 2-year graduate program and that their loans are deferred for another 2 years. Student B's loan will continue to accumulate interest over this time and, once again, they capitalize their interest. If they agree to a repayment plan on June 1 of the year they finish their graduate programs, how much will each one owe each month?      You are on the staff of a U.S. representative who serves on the Education and Workforce Committee. A discussion of the types of student loans is on the agenda for the next meeting, and you have been asked to come up with three proposed ways to structure federal subsidized and unsubsidized loan offerings and submit a memo with an analysis of each of them and a recommendation for the one you think is most appropriate.    Let’s do a stakeholder analysis. Make a list of all those who would be impacted by implementing the structures you are considering. Include both primary stakeholders (directly affected) and secondary stakeholders (indirectly affected). Try to see the situation through the eyes of all possible stakeholders.  Test your options by determining how the stakeholders you identified are harmed or benefited by implementing or not implementing these structures. Test options by filling in the following tables. You can add rows for more stakeholders and make additional tables for more options.     Stakeholder  Primary or Secondary?  Harms  Benefits                           Make a decision: write a memo to the representative you work for explaining and analyzing your three proposed structures. State your recommendation first, and then justify your decision with explicit reference to the stakeholder analysis.      Finally, reflect on your decision. What was the nature of your justification? Look back at the ethical lenses from Santa Clara University. Which lens(es) best fit your recommendation? Was that the same or different from what you identified at the beginning of this activity? Does that surprise you? Why or why not? Write a brief paragraph responding to these questions and include it with your memo.    "

  "body": "  Let's look at an example. Student A takes out the maximum in Direct Subsidized Loans each year for four years: $3,500, $4,500, $5,500, and $5,500. Student B takes out equivalent amounts in Direct Unsubsidized Loans.  The rate as of this writing is 6.39% effective annual for the life of the loan, compounded monthly. For simplicity, let's assume that the same interest rate applies to each of the four loans taken out by each student.    Create a timeline for the loan disbursements for each student through June 1 at the end of their fourth year of college; assume each of them receives the disbursement on September 1 of the relevant year and that the student with the unsubsidized loan *capitalizes* their interest by rolling their interest payments into the principal.    Determine the accumulated value of each of their loans on June 1 of the end of their fourth year of college.    Assume each borrower agrees to a 15-year repayment plan on that day. How much will each one owe each month?    Now assume that each of Student A and B enroll in a 2-year graduate program and that their loans are deferred for another 2 years. Student B's loan will continue to accumulate interest over this time and, once again, they capitalize their interest. If they agree to a repayment plan on June 1 of the year they finish their graduate programs, how much will each one owe each month?   "

Often we encounter annuities where the payments change this way. In this activity, we will review how to use the data describing a sequence in geometric progression to construct a series.    Let's start with a motivating example. We will solve the problem in the next activity.  Suppose we purchase a retirement account that pays us annually at the end of each of the next 12 years. The first payment, at the end of this year, is 20,000. Each payment thereafter grows by 2% as a cost of living adjustment. Our purchase price was based on a valuation using an effective annual interest rate of . Find the purchase price.    Sketch a timeline for this problem. Instead of calculating the payments at each time, leave them in the form for an appropriate .    Why are our annuity formulas inapplicable for this problem?    A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers in geometric progression. They have an initial amount , and their general term is where is the ratio of and . For the sequence to be geometric, this ratio must be constant for all terms.  You might notice that the algebraic form is the same as a exponential function. That is true! A geometric sequence can be thought of as an exponential function \"sampled\" at integer-valued points.    For each of the following sequences, determine if it is geometric. If it is, find , , and an expression for a generic term in the sequence.     .     .     .     .     .    Often, geometric series present themselves through an initial amount and a constant percentage change . The relationship between and is .    For each of the following, find an expression for the generic th term.    A geometric sequence begins with the value 3 and each term grows by 5%.    A geometric sequence begins with the value 143 and each term decreases by 2.5%.    A geometric sequence begins with the value 20 and each term decreases by 12.5%.    Each term of a geometric sequence grows by 4%, and the second term is 5.2.    When we add up some of the terms of a geometric sequence, the sum is a geometric series . The (finite) geometric series formula is:     Construct and calculate the following geometric series.    We start with 2, and form a sequence by tripling the prior value. If we add up the first 9 numbers, what do we get?    We have a sequence of numbers starting with 15 and grows by 2.5%. If we add up the first 15 numbers, what do we get?    We have a sequence of numbers starting with 3.45, decreases by 1.5%. If we add up the first 10 numbers in the sequence, what do we get?      Recall that the sum of an infinite series is the limit of the partial sums:     Find a formula for an infinite geometric series and state the values of for which it converges.    Use your formula to solve the following amusing problem.    The Supreme Court case The Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 279 U.S. 716 (1929), concerned a taxpayer whose employer paid their income taxes for them. The question before the court was whether taxes paid by a third party constituted income under the internal revenue code. The attorneys for the taxpayer argued that if the court ruled in favor of the government (that the taxes paid by the employer WAS additional income), then there would be no way for an employer to pay their employee taxes for them. If they paid taxes on the taxes that they paid, this would have to be taxed, and so on to infinity. The court ruled that the taxes paid were income (the statute levies taxes on all income \"from any source whatsoever\"), but that the calculation was limited to one iteration.  We know better. If you think about it, since the tax rate is less than 1, we would have a convergent infinite geometric series whose sum we can calculate.  In 1916, when the event that led to the litigation occurred, the top tax rate was 15%. Let us assume that we had a flat tax at the 15% rate. In addition, let us assume that the taxpayer had an annual income of 30,000. Work out why we have a geometric series and find the total taxes due.  (As a fun but irrelevant fact, the chief justice of the court at this time was William Howard Taft, the only former President to serve on the Supreme Court. He wrote the court decision in this case).      Look back at the motivating problem at the beginning of this activity. There are two percentage changes that contribute to the present or future value of this annuity. What are they?    "

The geometric series formula can be used in one of the two following ways (why?):   As a matter of strategy, I typically use the version that gives me a positive denominator.  In what follows, you will need to do some factoring and reindexing to set up your series. Review before working this activity.    Let's start by solving our motivating example.

Annual end-of-year deposits are made to a fund paying an annual effective rate of interest of 6%. The first deposit is 1,000 and then they go up by 3% annually. Interest from the 6% account is paid out annually and is reinvested at an annual effective discount rate of 4%. At the end of the thirty years, the funds are liquidated.

  "body": " Annuities with Payments in Geometric Progression 3 -- Further Problems   We will conclude our discussion of annuities with payments in geometric progression with a few miscellaneous matters that round out the subject. In this activity, we will address:    Using annuities to create a theoretical price for a share of stock;    Valuing annuities where the payment frequency and the frequency of changes in the payments are different; and    Identifying how the real interest rate can play a role.      The Dividend Discount Model for Valuing Stock  Valuing shares of stock is highly nontrivial, and our best methods are built on serious assumptions that some find problematic. You will see more of this in future exams like IFM.  For now, we are going to find a \"theoretical price\" for a share of stock by viewing the stock as a set of cash flows, namely, their dividends. This is not a realistic assumption, as companies are never guaranteed to distribute dividend payments (and even if they do, it is rarely predictable in advance). Nevertheless, using the cash flow generated by future dividends provides a nice application of annuities.    Let's start by finding these theoretical price formulas.    Suppose we know that a company is going to issue periodic dividends of . The periodic interest rate is . Find a formula for the present value, which is the theoretical price of the stock.    Now suppose that the next dividend is , and each subsequent dividend grows by a constant percentage . Find the formula for the theoretical price.      Use your models for the following exercises.    Find the theoretical price of a stock that pays an annual dividend of 4.5. The effective annual interest rate is 2.25%.    Find the theoretical price of a stock will pay a quarterly dividend. The first dividend will be paid 1 year from now, and will be 10. Each dividend will grow by 3%. The effective quarterly interest rate is 4%.      A share of James Brown Inc (JBI) is trading for 125. The company issues annual dividends. The dividend at the end of this year will be 5, and each subsequent dividend will be 3% larger. What effective annual interest rate is implied by this price?      Different Payment and Geometric Frequencies  Sometimes the frequency of the payments does not match the frequency of the percentage changes in the payments. For example, it is common to have pension payments given monthly, but adjusted for cost of living annually based on the CPI. The following former exam problem illustrates this.    Stan elects to receive his retirement benefit over 20 years at the rate of 2000 per month beginning one month from now. The monthly benefit increases by 5% each year. At a nominal interest rate of 6% convertible monthly, calculate the present value of the retirement benefit.    Generate a timeline.    The strategy to solve this is going to be to \"annualize\" the annuity by finding an equivalent sequence of payments that occur at the same frequency as the percentage changes.  To this end, find an expression for the value of the first 12 payments. Do not evaluate the expression, just write it down. (You choose when to value)    Find an expression for the value of the second 12 payments (payments 13 through 24). Do not evaluate the expression, just write it down.    One more time! Find an expression for the value of the third set of 12 payments (payments 25 through 36). Do not evaluate the expression, just write it down.    What do you notice about your expressions?    If we were to want to find an equivalent annuity but with annual payments (in geometric progression), what would the payments be? Do not evaluate, leave each payment as an expression (and you do not have to write all 20 expressions down!).    Let us fix the details. For the chunks of 12 payments, what interest rate should you use? What about for valuing the full annuity?    With all of this set-up, solve the problem.      Describe the strategy we used. What other choice could we have made to solve the problem?      Using   In , we saw that we can adjust the effective interest rate to deal with the impact of an inflation rate , in which case we had:   Solving for the rate itself, we can simplify to get:   Now suppose is the percentage rate at which the payments of an annuity increase.

Now we pivot to payments in arithmetic progression (i.e. grow or decline by a constant absolute amount).  The present value of an annuity with payments, starting with a payment of and whose payments grow by per period is written where is the effective periodic interest rate. Such an annuity is called an increasing annuity immediate .   Timeline for an increasing annuity immediate.  A timeline with K at 1, 2K at 2, up to nK at n. The present value of an increasing annuity with first payment K is labeled at time 0.   The future value of an annuity with payments which decrease by per period and whose last payment is is written . Such an annuity is called a decreasing annuity immediate .   Timeline for a decreasing annuity immediate.  A timeline with K at n, 2K at n-1, up to nK at 1. The present value of a decreasing annuity with last payment K is labeled at time 0.     What is the amount of the last payment of an increasing annuity immediate with payments starting with and growing by each time?      What is the amount of the first payment of a decreasing annuity immediate with payments shrinking by each time whose last payment is ?

Express both the present and future values symbolically.                     We can use timelines to find relationships between increasing and decreasing annuities. For each of the following, (i) create two timelines, one for each term, (ii) combine the two into a single timeline, and (iii) Describe the result of the combination financially.                For each of the following problems, generate one or more equations whose solution will solve the problem.

  "title": "Solving Problems with Payments in Arithmetic Progression 2",
  "body": " Solving Problems with Payments in Arithmetic Progression 2  When reviewing arithmetic sequences, you noticed that sometimes an arithmetic sequence starts with a multiple of the common difference and sometimes it does not. The same is true when we have an annuity with payments in arithmetic progression. So far we have assumed that the payments start at and increase by (or decrease by and end at ). Now we are going to ask how this changes if we start with a payment of and increase by (or decrease by and end at ). This involves chunking.  Once we examine this, we will solve some former exam problems.    Let's start with arithmetic sequences. The th term is . How can we rewrite this formula if we want to make it look like ? More specifically, if we write as a constant plus , what is that constant?      Keeping the previous question in mind, consider the following exercises.  For each of the following, (i) create two timelines, one for each term, (ii) combine the two into a single timeline, and (iii) Describe the result of the combination financially.                Consider how to generalize the exercises you completed.    If is the first payment of an annuity whose payments increase by each period, find two formulas for the present value, and two formulas for the future value (use actuarial notation generously, do not feel the need to drill down to the details).    Looking at your formulas, which one best resembles your response to the first question?    Analogize to decreasing annuities: find two formulas for the present value, and two formulas for the future value of a decreasing annuity whose payments decrease by and whose last payment is .      Find the following values. Use an effective interest rate of 5% for both.    We have ten payments starting at 50, with each payment increasing by 10. Find the present value.    We have twenty payments. The first payment is 190, each payment thereafter decreases by 5. Find the accumulated value immediately after the final payment.      It can be tricky to determine whether a decreasing annuity requires chunking or not. Consider the following two annuities:    Annuity 1: Four payments, first payment is 50, payments increase by 10.    Annuity 2: Four payments, first payment is 50, payments decrease by 10.    Do both annuities require chunking? Why or why not? How do you know? Where do you look regarding the decreasing annuity?      Solve the following former exam problems.    Sandy purchases a perpetuity-immediate that makes annual payments. The first payment is 100, and each payment thereafter increases by 10. Danny purchases a perpetuity-due which makes annual payments of 180. Using the same effective annual interest rate, , the present value of both perpetuities are equal. Calculate .    1000 is deposited into Fund , which earns an effective annual interest rate of 6%. At the end of each year, the interest earned plus an additional 100 is withdrawn from the fund. At the end of the tenth year, the fund is depleted. The annual withdrawals of interest and principal are deposited into Fund , which earns an effective annual rate of 9%. Determine the accumulated value of Fund at the end of year 10.      With level-payment annuities, we can find an unknown interest rate using our financial calculators. For increasing and decreasing annuities, that isn't the case. However, sometimes a problem is set up in a way that we actually can find an unknown interest rate, as in the following former exam problem.  Victor invests 300 into a bank account at the beginning of each year for 20 years. The account pays out interest at the end of every year at an effective annual interest rate of %. The interest is reinvested at an effective annual rate of %. The yield rate on the entire investment over the 20 year period is 8% effective annual. Determine .  NOTE: The term \"yield rate\" here means the interest rate that one would use for an annuity (without reinvestment) with payments of 300 that would result in the same future value (or present value) as the scheme that Victor engaged in (was this me??).      What do you think is the most challenging part of working with increasing and decreasing annuities?    "

  "title": "Ethics Case Study -- Reparations",
  "body": " Ethics Case Study -- Reparations  For decades, there have been calls for America to pay reparations to African Americans, most of whom are descendants of enslaved people. Those who argue for reparations believe that they are compensation for the value contributed to the United States by enslaved people. We are going to analyze this question using our ethical decision framework.    Let's start by learning about the problem. Here's a short video from the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) which discusses the arguments around reparations.     What are some of the groups that have received reparations around the world? Choose two of these groups. How are the circumstances of their claims similar to those of the descendants of enslaved people in the US? How are they different?    What are some of the forms that reparations could take in the US for the descendants of enslaved people?    What are some of the forms that you could envision reparations for descendants of enslaved people taking in the US? What would be the advantages and disadvantages of each?    One problem around discussing reparations is putting a price tag on the harm done to the community. Enslaved people were denied the right to earn wages for their labor, which consequently denied them the right to invest those earnings in the kinds of investments we discuss in this course - loans (including those to buy property), stocks, and bonds. The time-value of those denied earnings has only increased in the years since.  The idea that families accumulate wealth over the years is called generational wealth . While other families that immigrated to the US were able to continue accumulating generational wealth, including that which they brought to the country, enslaved people were stripped of most or all of their possessions and didn't have the opportunity to accumulate wealth until they gained their freedom.  Can we estimate how much money they lost, and what the current value of those lost wages would be?    We are going to first determine the value today of the contributions of enslaved people, and we are going to make several assumptions along the way. Our data are limited, and since the first U.S. census was completed in 1790, we will only value the contributions of enslaved people starting in 1790. We will also use an effective annual interest rate of 5.18%, which is the U.S. average (between 1790 and 2012, according to a study by Yamada). We assume that this rate captures the effect of inflation.    First, let us consider the lost wages of an enslaved person in 1790. While estimating incomes during the early history of the US is difficult, researchers at the National Board of Economic Research found in a 2014 working paper that the per capita income in the US in 1774 was 69.10, which would be 78.48 in 1790 dollars. This gives us a useful starting point to estimate the lost wages of enslaved people.  In 1790, there were 654,000 enslaved people, according to the census. While there are questions about how accurate this data is, especially in its count of enslaved people, we can use this to give us an overall estimate of lost wages. By examining census figures for enslaved people each decade up until 1860, examining growth rates, and taking a geometric average, the enslaved population grew by approximately 30% every ten years. Slavery ended (officially at least) in 1865. If the population grew by 30% every year, how much did it grow by each year?    We now have the information we need to create an estimate of the future value of these lost wages in the current year.  Build an excel spreadsheet which estimates the following in each year from 1790 to 1865:   The enslaved population in the US.    The annual lost wages, per capita, for each enslaved person. You can assume that lost wages grow by 5.10% per year.    Total annual lost wages for the entire enslaved population of the US.    Value of those total annual lost wages in the current year. Again, you can assume that the effective annual interest is 5.10%.     The sum of the future values of the total annual wages from each year should give you an estimate of the future value of the total lost wages for all enslaved people during the years 1790-1865.    Pause for a moment and consider the figure you just calculated. Besides some of the simplifying assumptions, what are we missing? Is this an over-estimate or an under-estimate?      Who are the stakeholders in this situation? If the US were to begin paying out reparations to the descendants of enslaved people, who would be affected?      Now that we have an estimate of what the current value of the lost wages is, develop some possible proposals for what reparations might look like. How could the US government effectively compensate the descendants of enslaved people for the wages denied to their ancestors? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?      Decide which plan most effectively compensates these descendants for the wages lost. Explain why you chose the plan that you did.      Consider the six ethical lenses published by the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University . Choose an ethical lens and examine your plan for reparations through that lens. Would you say that this plan is ethical.      Write a memo setting forth and defending a recommendation on reparations. Be sure to support your position and address counterarguments.    "

  "title": "General Principles of Loan Amortization",
  "body": " General Principles of Loan Amortization  When a loan is paid off, each payment has two components: the amount of interest paid , and the amount of principal paid, :   This notation sometimes vary from one text to another, so just be sure to understand the symbols you are using in any given context.  When loans are paid off, we say the loan is amortized. The word amortization refers to the payment of an original loan amount carrying a periodic interest rate with periodic payments . Sometimes there are different interest rates over different periods. Note that sometimes repayment schedules with constant payments ( for all ) is referred to as amortization or \"the amortization method.\" We try to avoid such terms in this book, but generally you can determine what the author means by context.  There are two general principles for loan amortization. The first is that the outstanding balance at any point in time is the present value of the remaining payments . In other words: Note that and as a consequence:   The second principle is what I call the recursive nature of amortization. If we start with , interest is accrued on this outstanding balance before the payment is applied.    Let's express the second principle with a couple of formulas.    Express using only and .    Express using only , , and .    Explain why I refer to this as recursive.      The following problem is from Broverman:  An amortized loan has 10 annual payments at the end of each year starting one year from now. The first 5 payments are 1000 each and the final 5 payments are 500 each. Interest is at an effective annual rate of 10%. Find each of the following:    The initial amount on the loan.    The outstanding balance just after the third payment.    The interest and principal in the fourth payment.    The outstanding balance just after the 8th payment.      An amortization schedule is a list that tracks payments, interest payments, principal payments, and the outstanding balance for each payment of the loan.  A loan of 100,000 carries an effective annual interest rate of . It is repaid with ten annual payments of 12,329.09 at the end of each year.  Complete the following amortization schedule for the first three years of the loan.        Payment  Interest Due  Principal Repaid  Outstanding Balance    0  -  -  -       1                2                3                    🧮 Calculator Corner  The financial calculator includes an amortization worksheet This worksheet will tell you how much principal and how much interest is in a given payment, as well as the balance immediately following the payment. It can only be used when your are amortizing with constant payments ( for all ).  To use the amortization worksheet, first enter all of the data that you have about the loan using N , I\/Y , PV , PMT , and FV . Have the calculator calculate any missing values.  Once that is entered, hit the AMORT button (hit 2ND followed by the PV button). For P1, enter the payment number you want to look at, and hit ENTER . Then hit the button, and for P2, enter the same payment number and hit ENTER (if P1 and P2 are different, the calculator will report the cumulative impact, as we will see later!).  Then you can use the and buttons and see the outstanding balance immediately after the payment (BAL), the principal repaid in the payment (PRN), and the interest in the payment (INT). The principal and interest payments will display as negative due to the sign convention of the calculator.     Use the financial calculator to redo the previous question. Do you prefer to use the amortization worksheet or amortizing by hand?    Almost every problem we will examine will involve a loan being repaid by one of three approaches:    Constant payments: for all (the most common approach),    Constant payments of principal: for all , or    Payment of interest only ( for all ), with principal paid off at the end.      A loan of 50,000 has a term of 5 years. The effective annual interest rate is . Construct the amortization schedule under each of the following repayment conditions:    The loan is repaid with five annual level payments.    The loan is repaid with five payments. Each payment consists of the outstanding interest plus a 10,000 payment of principal.    The annual payments consist only of interest, and the balance is paid off at the end of the term.      What did you notice about the amortization schedules in the previous question?      Sometimes an interest rate changes during the term of a loan. Suppose a loan of 100,000 is paid off with ten annual payments. For the first four years, the interest rate is 6%, and for the last six years, the interest rate is 7.5%. The first four payments are 13,586.80. The last six payments are .    Find .    Find     Find       Suppose the interest rate does not change during the life of a loan. Then we have the following identity (which is very useful, especially in \"puzzle problems\"):     Verify this identity.    Rewrite the identity under the assumption that we have constant payments.    Still assuming constant payments, use this identity to write an equation for using only and .    Let's look at an example of a \"puzzle problem\" that this identity helps us solve.  Suppose we have a loan carries an effective monthly interest rate of and is paid off with monthly payments of 800. If , find .      You might run into a problem that does not quite fit into one of the three repayment approaches we outlined above. In these cases, it is helpful to write out two or three rows of an amortization schedule and look for patterns. To find patterns, it is helpful to write out your calculation steps.    A 30-year loan of 1000 is repaid with payments at the end of each year. Each of the first ten payments equals the amount of interest due. Each of the next ten payments equals 150% of the amount of interest due. Each of the last ten payments is . The lender charges interest at an effective annual rate of 10%. Calculate .    We can characterize the repayment in the middle ten payments in this problem as payment by multiples of interest. We could derive formulas for such a repayment scheme. Is it worth it? Why or why not?      This activity covered a lot of ground, all of which forms the foundation for the rest of the chapter. Write down three important points that come out of this activity.    "

The prospective method is \"forward looking,\" meaning we use to find . The retrospective is \"backwards looking,\" meaning we use to find .    The prospective form of the outstanding balance of a loan is the version that equates the outstanding balance with the present value of the remaining payments. Make a timeline and write a formula to represent the prospective form.      The retrospective form of the outstanding balance uses only the payments already made: (this also requires the loan amount and the interest rate ). By carefully valuing both and the previous payments at time , make a timeline and write a formula to represent the prospective form.      A loan of 150,000 is to be repaid with payments of 899.33 at the end of each month for 30 years. The interest rate on the loan is 6% convertible monthly.    Find the balance using the prospective method.    Find the balance using the retrospective method.    Which do you prefer? Why?     🧮 Calculator Tip  If payments are constant, after you enter in all of the information about a loan (and having the financial calculator find any missing values), you can mimic the retrospective method on the calculator to find by setting N equal to and using CPT  FV . You can also use the AMORT worksheet.     Solve the following two problems. Think strategically about how you find the outstanding balance in each case.    A loan of 10,000 is being repaid by installments of 2000 at the end of each year, and a smaller final payment made one year after the last regular payment. Interest is at the effective rate of 12%. Find the amount of the outstanding loan balance remaining when the borrower has made payments equal to the amount of the loan. Answer to the nearest dollar.    A loan is amortized over five years with monthly payments at a nominal interest rate of 9% compounded monthly. The first payment is 1000 and is to be paid one month from the date of the loan. Each succeeding monthly payment will be 2% lower than the prior payment. Calculate the outstanding loan balance immediately after the 40th payment is made.

Let's look at an example.    A loan of 5000 is being repaid with periodic payments of 300. The periodic effective interest rate is 2%. How many payments must be made to pay off the loan?    What is the issue with your answer?    To deal with the issue you identified, we make modifications to the final payment so that the loan is paid off.    One modification is a balloon payment . This is what we do when we round the number of payments down and make the final payment larger than the other payments.    What do you need to calculate in order to find the amount that must be added to the last regular payment?    Find the amount of a balloon payment in our example.    The other option is a drop payment . We add an extra payment to the payment schedule, and this payment is a smaller than the other payments.  What do you need to do in order to find the drop payment?    Calculate the amount of a drop payment in our example.     🧮 Calculator Tip  You can find the amount of a balloon or drop payment in your calculator:    First, enter in all of your loan information and have the calculator CPT  N .    Next, round your value of down, enter the result for N , and CPT  FV .    For a balloon payment, add the result to the regular payment. For a drop payment, hit ± , enter as PV , enter 1 for N , 0 for PMT , and CPT  FV .       (Problem 15) Prince Akeem of Zamunda borrows 75,000 to purchase a car.

Find the amount of the original balloon payment.    Suppose he decides to round up his monthly payment to 2000 (starting with the first payment), and complete his payoff with a drop payment instead of a balloon payment. Find the number of payments of 2000 he will make, and find the amount of the drop payment.      Sometimes a problem will tell you how many payments there are, and that the last payment is larger or smaller than the other payments. In this case, you are given and the th payment is either a balloon payment or a drop payment. This means that there are exactly regular payments. If you are not told the regular payments, you can calculate them as usual, but then round to adjust for the balloon payment or drop payment.    If you round the regular payment down, will the final payment be a little larger or a little smaller than the regular payment? Why?

  "body": " Ethics Case Study -- Redlining  Redlining* was the practice of limiting home mortgage loans to low-income neighborhoods based on factors other than financial qualification: the name comes from maps in which neighborhoods were outlined in red.  While racially motivated redlining was made illegal under the Fair Housing Act in 1968, the effects have lingered. In this activity, we'll consider some of these effects and how they might be remedied.    Before we start, read about the six ethical lenses published by the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University . Which lens(es) do you think you will bring to this analysis?    Read about the history of redlining in this article on the Federal Reserve's website . Which aspect(s) of this history surprise you the most?      One way the effect of redlining continues to be felt is through school funding. Schools are funded by property taxes, giving a direct link between the wealth of a neighborhood and the funding received by the neighborhood's schools. Explain how redlining impacts school funding, and the cyclic problem that this creates. In addition, identify the assumptions we make in asserting that there is a cyclic problem.    We can also examine whether or not there is currently any racial discrimination in the real estate market. Google “racial differences in mortgage lending” and \"steering in real estate\" and describe what you find. You can follow up with other search terms as well.    You are on the staff of the director of your county's housing office. The director has requested three proposals for measures the county can take to counteract the effects of redlining. You are to submit a report with an analysis of each of them and a recommendation for the one you think is most appropriate.    Let’s do a stakeholder analysis. Make a list of all those who would be impacted by implementing the measures you are considering. Include both primary stakeholders (directly affected) and secondary stakeholders (indirectly affected). Try to see the situation through the eyes of all possible stakeholders.    Test your options by determining how the stakeholders you identified are harmed or benefited by implementing or not implementing these structures. Test options by filling in the following tables. You can add rows for more stakeholders and make additional tables for more options.     Stakeholder  Primary or Secondary?

  "body": " Bond Vocabulary  We begin this chapter by looking closer at how bonds work and the associated vocabulary and notation. We will unveil this in layers to avoid overwhelming the reader. As you learn more about bonds, it helps to remember that this is a cash stream of coupon payments with a principal repayment at the end, all valued using an interest rate.    We will begin with the basic payments. There are periodic payments called coupon payments (like the interest on a loan) The word \"coupon\" comes from an earlier practice, where a bond was represented by a certificate, and there was a book of \"coupons\" attached that the bondholder would bring to the bank to exchange for payment. , and an amount called the redemption amount paid with the last coupon payment. This cash flow is valued at an interest rate, called the yield rate .    Suppose a bond has ten coupon payments of 50, with a redemption amount of 1000. Generate a timeline for this bond.    Use an effective yield rate of 6% to find the present value of this bond.      The coupon payments are calculated by multiplying a rate, called the coupon rate (expressed as a percentage), by an amount called the face value of the bond. Often, but not always, the face value and redemption amount are the same. So the coupon rate is like an interest rate on a loan, and the face amount is like the principal, and the yield rate is a market interest rate used to value the cash stream.    Suppose a bond has six coupon payments, a coupon rate of 4%, a face amount of 1000, and a redemption amount of 1250. Generate a timeline for this bond.    Find the present value if the effective yield rate is 3%.      The notation for bonds is typically as follows:     = the face value     = the coupon rate     = the redemption amount     = the yield rate     = the number of payments    Generate a timeline for a general bond, and write an expression for the present value.      We have a few final definitions, as well as some assumptions, to introduce.    The time to the final payment is called maturity , and when the final payment occurs, the bond is said to have matured . This is often measured in years.    When , we often say that the bond is a par-valued bond, or a bond that is redeemed at par .    When the frequency of coupon payments is unstated, they are assumed to be semiannual .    Unless otherwise stated, coupon rates and yield rates are quoted as nominal rates, convertible at the same frequency as the coupon payments.      A par-valued bond has a face value of 1000, a coupon rate of 10%, and matures in 10 years. The yield rate is 12%. Determine the coupon payments, , and the present value.    A bond with a face value of 2000 has annual coupons at a rate of 8%, matures in 15 years, and is redeemed at par. The yield rate is 6%. Determine the coupon payments, , and the present value.    A bond with a face value of 1000, a coupon rate of 9%, and matures in 12 years with a redemption amount of 1250. The yield rate is 10%. Determine the coupon payments, , and the present value.      Consider a bond with a face value of 1000, a coupon rate of 10%, maturing in 5 years, with a redemption amount of 1250. The yield rate is 12%.  Determine which of the following statements are true, and for those that are false, correct them.    At the end of five years, the issuer will pay the bondholder 1000.    There will be 5 coupons.

  "title": "Bond Pricing",
  "body": " Bond Pricing  The price of a bond is the present value of the cash stream, valued at the yield rate. We often say that the bond is priced to yield the yield rate. While we will mostly use the yield rate to calculate the price, we will see in that often prices determined through exchange are used to identify market yield rates.    The fact that the price of a bond is the present value of the payments should not surprise you. However, let us verify why this makes sense with an arbitrage argument. Assume an investor can borrow or lend at the yield rate without transaction costs, and can pay the loan back with interest payments, and a final payment of principal at the end of the loan.    Suppose the price of a bond is lower than the present value of the payments. Describe an arbitrage opportunity.    Suppose the price of a bond is higher than the present value of the payments. Describe an arbitrage opportunity.      The no-arbitrage rule says that the price must equal the present value.  Use this principle to write down a formula for the price of a bond.      The face value of a bond is 1000, the redemption amount is 1250, the coupon rate is , the bond matures in five years. Find the price to yield 12%.      We think of the price of a bond as a function of the yield rate ( ), with , , , and as parameters.    What will happen to the price of a bond if the yield rate rises? Alternatively, what will the sign of be? (You do not need to find !)    What will happen to the yield rate if the price of the bond rises?    On March 3, 2020, CNN Business reported that: \"The 10-year [US] Treasury bond yield dropped below 1% for the first time in history on Tuesday, as investors grew increasingly worried about the novel coronavirus outbreak.\"  What do you think reporters observed in the bond market? Why does this make sense?     🧮 Calculator Corner  The financial calculator can be used to price bonds. Use for N , for I\/Y (as a whole number), the negative of the coupon payment (us ± ) for PMT , and the negative of the redemption amount (use ± ) for FV , then PV will return the price of the bond. You can also adapt this to solve for unknown values.     Use the financial calculator to price the following bonds as indicated:    The face value and the redemption amount are 1000, the coupon rate is 10%, and the bond matures in five years. Price to yield 12%.    The face value and the redemption amount are 1000, the coupon rate is 10%, and the bond matures in five years. Price to yield 8%.      For each of the following bonds, solve for the unknown value.    A bond with annual coupon payments is priced to yield an effective annual rate of 4%. The price is 10,445.18. The bond has a face value of 10,000 and is redeemed at par in five years. Find the coupon rate.    A bond priced to yield 8% has a price of 4776.87. The bond carries a face value of 5000, a coupon rate of 6%, and matures in 20 years. Find the redemption amount.    A bond with a face value of 1000 sells for 948.71. The coupon rate is 4%, and it matures in 6 years. The bond is redeemed at par. Find the rate that the bond is priced to yield.    A bond priced to yield 5% has a price of 891.74. The bond has a coupon rate of 7%, a redemption amount of 900, and matures in 3 years. Find the face value.    A zero-coupon bond is a bond that pays no coupons (i.e. the coupon rate is ). If a zero-coupon bond has a redemption amount of 1000 due in 2 years, and is trading for 910.21, find the yield rate as an effective semiannual interest rate.     🧮 Calculator Tip  If you do not clear the TVM functions on the calculator, it will keep all values that you have not changed. So if you are pricing multiple bonds, where only one or two of the values change, you only need to change those values and recalculate the price.     For each of the following bonds, the face value is 1000, and the coupon rate is 4%. Price each bond to yield 5%.    Redeemed for 1050 at the end of 4 years.    Redeemed for 1050 at the end of 6 years.    Redeemed for 1025 at the end of 7 years.    Redeemed for 1025 at the end of 9 years.  \\newpage  Redeemed at par at the end of 10 years.      A zero-coupon bond pays no coupons and only pays a redemption amount at the time the bond matures. Greta can buy a zero-coupon bond that will pay 10,000 at the end of 10 years and is currently selling for 5,083.49. Instead she purchases a 10% bond with coupons payable semiannually that will pay 10,000 at the end of 10 years. If she pays she will earn the same annual effective interest rate as the zero-coupon bond. Calculate .      A 1,000 10% ten-year bond has semiannual coupons. It is purchased at 880 and is redeemable at 1020. Find the coupon amount and the effective yield rate per coupon period.      Do you need to memorize the formula for the price of a bond? Why or why not?    "

  "body": " Premium and Discount Bonds  We have made loans an analogy to understand bonds. For this analogy to fit perfectly, then the face value would have to be the loan amount (since the interest payments would have to be ). The price would also have to be the loan amount, and would have to be the future value of the loan amount. Since this is rarely the case, the analogy breaks down when we look closely, leading to some subtleties in the way bonds are understood.  In this section, we focus on the difference between the price and the redemption amount .    Find the price of each of the following bonds with annual coupon payments:    Bond A: , , , and .    Bond B: , , , and .    Bond C: , , , and .      Compare your two results. What do you notice? What do you wonder?      We have the following definitions:    A bond is said to be bought at a premium if .    A bond is said to be bought at par if .    A bond is said to be bought at a discount if .    For bonds A, B, and C, determine which were bought at a premium (if any), which were bought at par (if any), and which were bought at a discount (if any). Can you identify an easy way to figure this out without using the price?      The amount of the premium or the discount is (the result is always expressed positively). Find the amount of premium or discount (if nonzero) for Bonds A, B, and C.      In order to quantify the amount of premium or discount without knowing the price, we derive an equivalent equation for the price of a bond called the premium-discount formula :     Show that this formula is equivalent to the formula we have been using for the price of a bond. Start by rewriting .    Based on this formula, if , how can you determine whether a bond is sold at a premium, par, or discount without calculating the price?    Suppose . Rewrite the bond discount formula and identify a simple test to determine whether a bond in this case is sold at a premium, par, or discount.    Explain why your simple test makes financial and economic sense (i.e., which we do not need any mathematics to explain this result to an investor or a supervisor at work).

  "body": " Bond Amortization  When we studied loans, we amortized them to figure out things like how much of principal was repaid in a payment, or what the outstanding balance was at the time of any payment. Based on our analogy comparing bonds to loans, we can do the same with bonds - in fact, we often have to do so for tax purposes. But the analogy will need some ... interpretation.    We start with some examples: a premium bond, a par bond, and a discount bond. We will assume and that coupons are paid annually (this keeps the computations simple and allows us to see the patterns).  In the tables that follow, the payment is simply the coupon payment for all payments except the last, where the payment is (to include redemption of the face amount). The outstanding balance at time 0 is the price of the bond. The interest due is the yield rate times the previous outstanding balance. The principal repaid is what is left of the payment after accounting for interest, and the outstanding balance is the previous outstanding balance minus the principal repaid.

What do you notice about the amortization schedule when the bond is bought at a premium? At par? At a discount? Why might that be?      In each of the three tables, add up the total principal repaid and compare to the premium or discount. What do you notice? How does that help us interpret what \"principal repaid\" means for a bond? Explain.    Before going on, we introduce some definitions and notation.    At time , the outstanding balance of the bond is called the Book Value and denoted . Note that , the price of the bond.    If the bond is priced at a premium, it is the premium that is amortized. We call that amortization of premium or writing down the bond.    If the bond is priced at a discount, it is the discount that is amortized. We call that accumulation of discount or writing up the bond.    We also have the following formulas:           Payment          0     -  -  -    1                                                                      0                Examine the formulas to answer the following questions - which will help you remember them!

  "title": "Callable Bonds",
  "body": " Callable Bonds  A callable bond is a bond that the issuer can redeem at certain specified times prior to the maturity date, sometimes with different redemption values.  Pricing callable bonds can be tricky since there is uncertainty. Typically, we decide what our desired yield rate is, identify \"worst case scenarios,\" and price the bond so that in all worst case scenarios we still reach our minimum yield. This may depend on whether the bond is priced at a premium, discount, or at par.    Let's consider a bond with annual coupons that is redeemed at par with after 10 years with , but which is callable at par after any coupon payment starting with the fifth.  Let's dispense with the trivial case first. Suppose you want a yield rate of 5%.    What is the price?    Would you be willing to accept a higher yield?    Would you be willing to accept a lower price? Would a lower price give you a higher or a lower yield?    What does it mean to say that the price you found is the maximum price you would pay in order to yield a minimum yield of 5%?      Now suppose you want a yield of at least 6%, so that we have a discount bond.    If you knew the bond would be called immediately after the fifth payment (i.e. you know ), what is the bond price?    If you knew the bond would not be redeemed until maturity (i.e. you know that ), what is the bond price?    There are two worst case scenarios. One is that you price the bond as if you knew it would be redeemed after 5 payments, but it is redeemed at maturity. If this happens, what is your yield rate?    The other worst case scenario is that you price the bond as if you knew it would not be redeemed until maturity, but is called immediately after the fifth payment. If this happens, what is your yield rate?    Which price do you pay? In other words, which price price guarantees a minimum yield rate of 6%?    What do you conclude about pricing callable discount bonds?    Note that we did not concern ourselves with redemption at any intermediate times (6,7,8, or 9). Why did we not need to do this? Try a couple of examples and explain why these do not factor into our \"worst-case scenarios.\"      Suppose instead you are willing to take a minimum yield rate of 4%, so we have a premium bond.    What are your worst case scenarios? Why?    Find appropriate prices, and use those prices to find the yield rates in each of your worst case scenarios.    Which price do you pay? In other words, which price price guarantees a minimum yield rate of 4%?    What do you conclude about pricing callable premium bonds?      Let us consider strategy for a moment.    Summarize what you found about pricing callable bonds.    Which do you prefer at this point - to use your rules that you summarized for pricing, or to just examine your worst case scenarios and pick the one that guarantees your minimum desired yield? (It is OK if you change your mind on this after you see more problems).      Explain in your own words the following \"Coach Remarks\" from Coaching Actuaries, and briefly explain why it makes sense. The wording in this remarks is often how questions on the exam are worded.    Given a price, the lowest yield rate calculated is the minimum yield that an investor would earn.    Given a yield rate, the lowest price calculated is the maximum price that an investor would pay.      A 10% bond with face amount 100 is callable on any coupon date from 15.5 years after issue up to the maturity date which is 20 years from issue.    Find the price of the bond to yield a minimum nominal annual rate of (i) 12%, (ii) 10%, and (iii) 8%.    Find the minimum annual yield to maturity if the bond is purchased for (i) 80, (ii) 100, and (iii) 120.      Let's generalize to a situation in which there are different possible redemption amounts depending on when the bond is called or redeemed. We will derive a strategy for pricing called \"the end point method.\"  Suppose we have a bond with a face value of 1000 and 15 annual coupon payments with . It can be redeemed for 1200 immediately after the 8th, 9th, or 10th payment, for 1100 immediately after the 11th, 12th, 13th, or 14th payment, or redeemed at par on the maturity date. We want a yield of 6%. What is the maximum price we should pay to guarantee this yield?    Complete the following table. The following calculator tip from 7.2 will help:  🧮 Calculator Tip If you do not clear the TVM functions on the calculator, it will keep all values that you have not changed. So if you are pricing multiple bonds, where only one or two of the values change, you only need to change those values and recalculate the price.     Redemption Time  Redemption Amount  Price to Yield 6%    8  1200      9  1200      10  1200      11  1100      12  1100      13  1100      14  1100      15  1000         The redemption times at 8, 10, 11, 14, and 15 are called endpoints . Explain what is meant by that.    What do you notice about prices between endpoints?    What is the lowest price? What could happen to your yield if you pay a higher price?    What happens if you pay a price lower than the smallest price in this table?    What is the maximum price you would be willing to pay in order to guarantee a yield of 6%?      A 1000 par value bond pays annual coupons of 80. The bond is redeemable at par in 30 years, but is callable any time from the end of the 10th year at 1050. Based on her desired yield rate, an investor calculates the following potential purchase prices :    Assuming the bond is called at the end of the 10th year, .    Assuming the bond is held until maturity, .    The investor buys the bond at the highest price that guarantees she will receive her desired yield rate regardless of when the bond is called. The investor holds the bond for 20 years, after which time the bond is called. Calculate the annual yield rate the investor earns.      Summarize a strategy for pricing callable bonds to guarantee a given minimum yield, and describe how to alter that strategy to identify a minimum yield given a price.    "

Redemption Time  Redemption Amount  Price to Yield 6%    8  1200      9  1200      10  1200      11  1100      12  1100      13  1100      14  1100      15  1000         The redemption times at 8, 10, 11, 14, and 15 are called endpoints . Explain what is meant by that.    What do you notice about prices between endpoints?    What is the lowest price? What could happen to your yield if you pay a higher price?    What happens if you pay a price lower than the smallest price in this table?    What is the maximum price you would be willing to pay in order to guarantee a yield of 6%?   "

  "body": " Problem Solving 10: Problem Solving with Bonds  As with loans, you will often encounter \"puzzle problems\" involving bonds. In , we talked about making a \"map\" with various formulas to help you find paths through puzzle problems. We encourage you to do the same with bonds, but in this section, we are going to focus on a few different strategy points to solve problems.    The first point is that we want to think strategically about which pricing formula we use in a problem.    Write the two price formulas we have for a bond.    Solve the following, and think strategically about which price formula you use.  An investor will pay 2,318.63 for an -year 2000 par bond with a coupon rate of 10% compounded semiannually or he will pay 2,531.05 for an -year 2000 par bond with a coupon rate of 11% compounded semiannually. Assuming that the investor gets the same yield on the two bonds, find this yield rate expressed as a nominal rate convertible two times per year. Also find .    Describe your strategy, and how your choice of pricing formula fit into that strategy.      We often set up a system of two equations, and instead of adding\/subtracting, we divide to cancel common factors. Use this approach to solve the following problem:  A 7% bond has a price of 79.30 and a 9% bond has a price of 93.10, both per 100 of face amount. Both are redeemable in years and have the same yield rate. Find .      The final point is that we do not always need to calculate the value of each variable to solve a problem. Sometimes it suffices to solve for expressions. Solve the following problem with this tip in mind:  A 10-year bond with semiannual coupons is bought at a discount to yield 9% convertible semiannually. If the amount for accumulation of discount in the next-to-last coupon is 8, find the total amount for accumulation of discount during the first four years in the bond amortization schedule.      Among a company's assets and accounting records, an actuary finds a 15-year bond that was purchased at a premium. From the records, the actuary has determined the following:    The bond pays semiannual interest.    The amount for amortization of the premium in the 2nd coupon payment was 977.19.    The amount for amortization of the premium in the 4th coupon payment was 1046.79.    What is the value of the premium?      You have decided to invested in two bonds. Bond is an -year bond with semiannual coupons., while bond is a zero-coupon bond, which is redeemable in years. The desired yield rate is the same for both bonds. You also have the following information:   Bond :    Par value is 1000.    The ratio of the semiannual bond rate to the desired semiannual yield rate, , is 1.03125.    The present value of the redemption value is 381.50.     Bond :    Redemption value is the same as that of bond .    Price to yield is 647.80.    What is the price of bond ?      Which approaches to solving problems resonate with you? What is still muddy?    "

  "title": "Ethics Case Study: Crypto-Backed Municipal Bonds",
  "body": " Ethics Case Study: Crypto-Backed Municipal Bonds  In November, 2025, the State of New Hampshire approved the authority to issue up to $100 million in municipal bonds backed by Bitcoin (BTC), the cryptocurrency that had the highest market share at the time. Municipal bonds are bonds issued by city and state governments (which we will collectively refer to as municipalities ). The income (coupon payments) from municipal bonds are exempt from federal income taxes, and as such are attractive to investors and typically carry low to no risk.  While municipal bonds are often issued to finance state and local government development projects, they are also used to raise funds that can be lent by the municipality to private companies who intend to use the loan proceeds to invest in a project that the municipality believes is in the public interest. The coupon and redemption payments are paid by the municipality to the investors out of the company’s loan payments.  For a cryptocurrency-backed municipal bond, a company that borrows from the municipality puts up BTC as collateral. Under the terms of the New Hampshire law, the company has to put up 160\\% of the loan amount as collateral. This is advantageous to the company since if they sold the Bitcoin or paid for their investments directly in Bitcoin, they would have to pay capital gains taxes on any increases in the value of the Bitcoin since its purchase. They get the collateral back when the loan is paid off.  Additionally, if the value of the collateral falls below 130% of the loan amount, the company has to add BTC to the collateral to restore the total to 160% . This is called a margin call .  These provisions about the BTC collateral are in place as BTC, and cryptocurrencies generally, are considered volatile and risky.    Let’s examine an example to get a sense of how the margin call works. Suppose such a municipal bond was offered in November 2024 instead of 2025. A company wants to borrow 1 million dollars through this mechanism, and puts up the collateral on December 6, 2024. On that date, one US Dollar cost 97,074.23 BTC. This means that the company had to put up approximately BTC as collateral.  The BTC Price spreadsheet contains the cost of one US Dollar in BTC for every day between December 6, 2024 and December 6, 2025 (Source: Yahoo Finance). Cell C1 contains the amount of collateral put up by the company in BTC.  Have Excel perform the following calculations for each day:     In Column C, calculate the value of the collateral in US Dollars.    In Column D, calculate the amount of additional deposit in US Dollars (use zero if no additional deposit is necessary).    In Column E, have Excel report a zero if there is no margin call and a one if there is a margin call.    In Cell D370, add up the total of all of the additional deposits.    In Cell E370, add up the total number of margin calls     Don’t forget that when there is an additional deposit, you have to redo Column C starting the next day!  Here are some Excel tools that will help you:     If your formulas include a cell reference such as $C$1, that tells Excel to leave the reference to cell C1 constant as you drag your formula (this is called a absolute cell reference - there are also mixed cell references that allow you to keep the row or the column fixed as you drag).    You can program Excel to report one of two possibilities depending on a condition. To do so, the syntax is:   =IF(condition, what to report if condition is true, what to report if condition is false)     To program Excel to add using commands instead of highlighting, you can use the following syntax:   =SUM(First Cell: Last Cell)      You are welcome to use R or Python or another programming language if you prefer.    Now that we have explored how the margin call works for this bond, let’s get into the situation.  You are an actuary at a firm that is writing an insurance policy for a company borrowing under the crypto-backed municipal bond program in New Hampshire. In exchange for the premiums, the policy will make any additional deposits necessary in the event of a margin call, with the full collateral reclaimed by the company when the loan is discharged. One of your colleagues was tasked with creating the pricing model. They passed the model on to underwriters who priced and issued the policy.  You soon find out that the Chief Actuary of your firm sits on the Board of Directors for the company whose collateral was insured. Under their direction, your colleague’s pricing model used only 2 years of BTC data to estimate the risk. You reran their analysis using 5 years of data and found a substantially higher risk, which would have increased the price of the policy. When you confront your colleague, they argue that 2 years of data is appropriate as market conditions had a significant change 2 to 3 years ago and older data isn’t comparable.  You aren’t convinced, and the relationship between the Chief Actuary and the company concerns you. That relationship has not been disclosed. You are considering reporting this to the press, although you will likely lose your job if you do so.    Review the Society of Actuaries Code of Professional Conduct. Identify all provisions that you believe were violated.      Conduct a stakeholder analysis:    Identify who could benefit from and who could be harmed by the conduct of the Chief Actuary and your colleague.    Describe the benefits as appropriate, and describe the harms as appropriate.    Identify who would benefit from and who could be harmed if you reported your findings to the press.    Describe the benefits as appropriate, and describe the harms as appropriate.        Consider your choices – what alternative options do you have? Consider who would benefit and would be harmed by any alternative options you identify, and describe those benefits and harms.      Make\/justify a decision. Write a memo to the files.      Think for a moment – did you make the right decision? How might you know? What could happen in the future that convinces you that you did the right thing? What could convince you that you did not do the right thing? Add a paragraph reflecting on our decision to your memo.    "

  "title": "Zero Coupon Bonds, Spot Rates, and the Yield Curve",
  "body": " Zero Coupon Bonds, Spot Rates, and the Yield Curve  We begin by defining the term structure of interest rates. A zero-coupon bond is, as you might expect, a bond that pays no coupons. United States Treasury Bills (\"T-bills\" for short) are zero-coupon bonds, typically with maturities less than one year. The yield rates on zero-coupon bonds are functions of the length of time to maturity, and those yield rates are referred to as spot rates . Taken together, the schedule of spot rates for various times is called the term structure of interest rates , and graphically referred to as the yield curve .    So far, we have talked about the yield on a bond as something specified ahead of time. For example, we may have priced a bond in order to make sure we yield a minimum rate. Market watchers invert this -- they watch bonds as they are traded in a secondary market and use the market prices to determine the yield rates.    Find the yield rates (as effective annual rates) for the following zero-coupon bonds, whose closing prices are given in the table. The redemption amount is 1000 for all three.     Time to Maturity   Price( )  Yield to Maturity (YTM)    1  966.18      2  924.56      3  882.62      4  845.01      5  809.20         One way to create a zero-coupon bond out of a coupon bond is to separate the interest and redemption payments into separate bonds and sell them. The Treasury STRIPS (T-STRIPS) program, introduced in January 1985, allows investors to buy, hold, and sell the individual coupon and redemption payments for U.S. Treasury Bonds. The acronym \"STRIPS\" stands for Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities.  Suppose the coupon payments for a 3-year, 5% US Treasury Bond with semiannual coupons, redeemable for 1000, are trading on the market according to the following schedule. Find the corresponding yield rates expressed as nominal annual rates convertible semiannually.     Coupon Payment Number  Price  Yield    1  24.51      2  23.80      3  23.05      4  22.43      5  21.78      6  21.15           The yield rates are called the spot rates , and typically denoted by either (where the subscript of 0 indicates these are the rates as of right now) or . Be aware that you may find alternative notation, and infer from context.    The schedule of spot rates over time is called the term structure of interest rates , and their graph is called the yield curve . Note that we often abuse the terms and freely interchange these two terms.    Using your work from , generate the term structure of interest rates. Express each spot rate as an effective annual interest rate.    Sketch the yield curve for the term structure you generated.      Using your work from generate the term structure and the yield curve, measuring in years and as nominal rates convertible semiannually.    What do you notice about your yield curves?      Yield curves tell you something about economic expectations.    The observations you made about the yield curves arising from and describe normal yield curves. Explain why we should typically expect to see normal yield curves in terms of risk.    Yield curves are not always normal. The following is an example of an inverted yield curve:   Inverted yield curve.    Note that the x-axis is not scaled, and the y-axis does not start at 0.  This graph was part of the yield curve in the United States on August 2, 2019, and was the first inversion in the US yield curve since 2007 (data source: United States Treasury).  What economic reasons might there be that shorter term investments are riskier than longer term investments? What macroeconomic expectation is the bond market signaling with this yield curve?    By contrasting with an inverted yield curve, what macroeconomic expectation does the bond market signal with a normal yield curve?    A third type of yield curve is a flat yield curve. Sketch a graph of a flat yield curve.    If there is a flat yield curve, how confident and certain are those in the bond market in the economic outlook? Explain.      Watch the video in (don't worry about the fact that they are generating the yield curve from coupon bonds). How does this explanation match your thinking in the last question?

Explain why we should typically expect to see normal yield curves in terms of risk.    Yield curves are not always normal. The following is an example of an inverted yield curve:   Inverted yield curve.    Note that the x-axis is not scaled, and the y-axis does not start at 0.  This graph was part of the yield curve in the United States on August 2, 2019, and was the first inversion in the US yield curve since 2007 (data source: United States Treasury).  What economic reasons might there be that shorter term investments are riskier than longer term investments? What macroeconomic expectation is the bond market signaling with this yield curve?    By contrasting with an inverted yield curve, what macroeconomic expectation does the bond market signal with a normal yield curve?    A third type of yield curve is a flat yield curve. Sketch a graph of a flat yield curve.    If there is a flat yield curve, how confident and certain are those in the bond market in the economic outlook? Explain.   "

  "body": " Spot Rates and Coupon Bonds  We can use the spot rates to price coupon bonds, and then figure out the yield rate for the coupon bond at that price. We can also reverse this relationship, and actually use coupon bond prices or yields to find the spot rates.    Given the term structure of interest rates (or equivalently, a yield curve), we price a coupon bond by pricing each payment separately using the appropriate spot rate. This is like \"stripping\" coupon bonds. We can then use the price we find to calculate the implied yield rate on the coupon bond. Use this approach to solve the following problem:  You are given the following term structure:   These are effective annual rates of interest for zero-coupon bonds of 1, 2, and 3 years maturity respectively. A newly issued 3-year bond with face amount 100 has annual coupon rate 10% with coupons paid once per year starting one year from now.  Find the price and effective annual yield to maturity of the bond.    Let's look at a more extended example.    A 10% bond with face amount 100 matures in 3 years.    Find the present value of the bond based on each of the following term structures and zero-coupon bond spot rates, where each denotes a nominal annual spot rate convertible semiannually for a -year zero coupon bond.                     For each of the bond prices you found, find the corresponding yield to maturity.    Repeat for an 8% bond and for a 12% bond.    What do you notice? What do you wonder?      Suppose you have a flat yield curve. If a coupon bond is priced using the spot rates, what can you say about the implied yield rate on the coupon bond? Justify your response.      We will now turn to reversing this process: given coupon bond prices, finding the spot rates. The method we will use is recursive, and called bootstrapping .  You are given the following information for 4 bonds. All coupon and yield-to-maturity rates are nominal annual convertible twice per year.     Bond  Time to Maturity  Coupon Rate  YTM    1  0.5-year  4%  0.05    2  1-year  6%  0.10    3  1.5-year  4%  0.15    4  2-year  8%  0.15     Find the associated term structure for zero coupon bonds with maturities of 0.5 years, 1 year, 1.5 years, and 2 years (quotations should be nominal annual rates convertible twice per year).    We start with Bond 1, with a maturity date in 0.5 years. This is essentially a zero-coupon bond (why?). Use that observation to find .    Now we have . Find the price of the second bond. Then set up and solve an equation for using the price. You can do this by pricing the bond using and .    Complete the problem and report the results as indicated.      Sometimes we aren't given enough information to use bootstrapping, as in the following problem.  You are given the following information about two 10-year bonds. Both bonds have face amount 100 and coupons payable semi-annually, with the next coupon due in 1\/2-year.    Bond 1: Coupon rate 4% per year, price 85.12    Bond 2: Coupon rate 10% per year, price 133.34    Find the yield rate for a 10-year zero-coupon bond.    Describe the cash flows for each coupon bond.    We would like to construct a transaction involving buying some of one bond and selling some of the other in which we have a net cash flow of 0 until maturity, creating a \"synthetic zero-coupon bond\" (I like to call this \"zeroing out the coupon payments\"). Determine what you will buy and what you will sell in order to do this for this problem.    Describe the net cash flows for your synthetic zero-coupon bond. Then use your net cash flows to solve the problem.      The at-par yield rate for a coupon bond is the yield rate at which the bond is priced at par. Equivalently, it is the yield rate that matches the coupon rate.    Assume that for a bond with coupons before maturity. Given spot rates for each , find a formula for the at-par yield rate. (We will see something similar with interest rate swaps in !).    The current term structure is defined by:   Calculate the at-par yield rate for a two-year bond.

  "body": " Forward Rates  In addition to spot rates, we can also describe how we expect interest rates to vary in the near future using forward rates. Forward rates are interest rates that are locked in today (at time 0), but are only in effect for a period of time at some point in the future (i.e., at some point forward in time). The typical notation is , which stands for the effective periodic interest measured now but is in effect between times and .  When and we are looking at , we use the following equivalent terms:    The time (or -time ) forward rate (note that this refers to the ending time).    The -deferred time- interest rate.    You may also see described as \"the deferred -year interest rate.\" There may be other equivalent terms you encounter, as well as alternate notation. As usual, refer to context to understand what the author intends.    Let's start by exploring the meaning of forward rates. For each of the following, create an interest rate timeline.              The three-year deferred year 4 interest rate.    The year 2 forward rate.           Given each of the following investment opportunities, find the forward rates implied by the offer, and express your answer using notation.

Suppose we have the following forward rates:      Use these forward rates to find the price and effective annual yield to maturity of a 4-year bond with face value 100, annual coupons at 4%, and a redemption amount of 120.

In the last activity we talked about the at-par yield rate -- the rate that makes the price of a bond redeemed at par equal to the face value.

  "body": " Arbitrage Revisited  In the last activity, you used arbitrage arguments to relate spot rates and forward rates. Nevertheless, since spot rates and forward rates are market-driven, they may not match and therefore there may be an opportunity for arbitrage.  When arbitrage exists, you can construct a transaction to take advantage of the opportunity buy following the age-old \"buy-low, sell-high\" strategy. In order to do this, you will have to create a \"synthetic\" version of the transaction that would occur if there were no arbitrage. You will do this quite a bit when preparing for the IFM Exam. In this activity, we will get a taste of this using forward and spot rates.  ⚠ Note that borrowing and paying back in a lump sum is the same as selling a zero-coupon bond, and lending with a lump sum repayment is the same as buying a zero-coupon bond.  We begin by exploring synthetic investments (sometimes called a \"net position\"). Then we use them to construct arbitrage transactions.    Suppose and .    Find the implied forward rate .    Suppose you want to borrow 100 at time 1 at the implied forward rate, with the total to be paid back at the end of year 2. Write down the net cash flows in years 0, 1, and 2.

  "title": "Ethics Case Study -- Speculation",
  "body": " Ethics Case Study -- Speculation  Spot rates and forward rates represent predictions about how the market thinks interest rates will move in the future. Those who purchase bonds, whether coupon-bearing or not, may not be investing so much for the bond itself as they are making a bet about whether they think the market is correctly predicting future interest rates. For example, if the yield curve is normal while an investor thinks interest rates are going to actually decline, they may purchase bonds with the intent to sell them for a profit after a reduction in interest rates. This is known as speculation .  It is more common to use the word speculation when the risks of loss and potential reward are higher. Most speculation is done in commodity markets and in secondary stock markets. Combined with herd behavior -- the tendency of investors to follow and copy one another's investing choices -- speculation can lead to \"bubbles\" in the market. This means that the value of the assets in the market significantly exceeds their intrinsic value. Some investors earn high returns during bubbles, and others suffer serious losses when the bubble \"bursts\" as it inevitably will. The difference between who makes money and who loses is a matter of chance timing.  Suppose you monitor and manage investments for an insurance company. Your department chair notices that there appears to be a bubble in energy stocks and asks you your thoughts about getting in on it before the bubble bursts. You tell them you will think about it and respond by the end of the day. Since you do not have time to look into the specifics of this bubble, you are going to consider investing in bubbles in general.     Step 1 : State the Problem.       Step 2 : Gather the Facts.  Run an internet search for recent asset or stock market bubbles. Describe what you found, the consequences when the bubble burst, and state your source.       Step 3 : Identify stakeholders. Consider both primary stakeholders (directly affected) and secondary stakeholders (indirectly affected). Try to see the situation through the eyes of all possible stakeholders.       Step 4 : Develop options. Be imaginative, avoid dilemmas or yes\/no situations. Instead consider how to modify questions and ask “to\/for whom” or “how much.\"       Step 5 : Test options by determining how the stakeholders you identified are harmed or benefited by an action or inaction. Test at least two options by filling in the following tables. You can add rows for more stakeholders, and make additional tables for more options.   Option 1 :     Stakeholder  Primary or Secondary?  Harms  Benefits                            Step 6 : Make a decision.       Step 7 : Check your work! Make sure your decision follows your gut instincts and your internal principles.      Write an memo to your department chair stating and defending your position. Be sure to support your position and address counterarguments (see outline in ).    "

  "title": "Ethics Case Study: AI Data Centers",
  "body": " Ethics Case Study: AI Data Centers  Data centers for artificial intelligence have significant environmental and economic consequences both globally and for nearby communities.    Read the United Nations Environment Programme’s Issue Note on AI from September, 2024, Artificial Intelligence (AI) end-to-end: The environmental impact of the full AI lifecycle needs to be comprehensively assessed . What did you read that you already knew? What surprised you?    In addition to environmental impacts, the presence of data centers near a community can lead to water shortages and significant increases in electricity costs, both due to the data center’s consumption of those resources.  You work at an actuarial firm located in a community where the County has received a request for permits to build an AI data center nearby. The community residents are worried about water shortages and they are worried about electricity costs. The County Commission plans to make quarterly deposits into a water fund in order to address concerns about the water supply. However, the residents are still worried about electricity costs.  Your firm sees an opportunity – they want to offer an insurance product to the community that covers any excessive electric costs in exchange for a premium. You are asked to come up with a pricing model and an estimate so that you can share the offer at a County Commission meeting that will take place tomorrow.  The firm purchases access to electricity forward reports. These are like forward interest rates, except instead of the cost of borrowing they represent the cost of electricity. Their calculations are based on inflation forecasts. You find the most recent report for a geographic region that resembles your community very well, and it is in the spreadsheet  .    Based on these data, you create a naïve, simple pricing model . The policy lasts 6 months, and then the premiums are reset based on more recent data. During the coverage period, every time a policy holder’s electric bill is one standard deviation above the mean (based on 1 year’s worth of forward prices and the electric bill for the month just prior to the coverage period), they will be reimbursed for the difference.  For a six month premium, you look at the claims you expect to pay (and then mark them up a for little bit for profit).    Let’s calculate the expected claims on a 6 month policy based on the forwards you accessed.  The spreadsheet contains forward prices for 12 months, including the current month (month 0). For the current month, this is the actual average electric bill in the relevant area. The growth factors will be the amount we multiply the previous forward price by to get the next forward price (like $1+ \\iota$ for interest rates). The growth factor in cell C2 is the growth factor from the previous month which is not in the report.  The directions below are for Excel, and you can use a programming language such as R or Python instead if you prefer.    Have Excel calculate the growth factors for the rest of the months in Column C.    In Cell C15, have Excel calculate the average growth factor.  Since these are growth factors , we use a geometric mean as we did for average interest rates in . Excel can calculate this using the following syntax:   =GEOMEAN(first cell: last cell)     In Cell 16, have Excel calculate the standard deviation (using sample standard deviation: STDEV.S in Excel-speak).  As with the mean, we need to use a geometric standard deviation . The way to get Excel to calculate this is to have it calculate:     In this case, calling the functions STDEV.S and LOG (along with “first cell:last cell” in the argument of LOG ) will be necessary.    In Column D, we will figure out the threshold above which the insurance policy pays out. To find the “Expected Forward” we multiply the month 0 price by the geometric mean growth factor compounded the appropriate number of months (why?). To add 1 standard deviation, we multiply the result by the geometric standard deviation compounded the same number of months (why?). Have Excel perform these calculations. Don’t forget to use absolute cell references (like $C$15 ).    We use a full year of forwards for our data, but we only price a six month policy. For the first 6 months (including 0), in Column E, find the expected payout based on these data assuming the forward prices are realized.  It might help to use the “max” function: “=MAX(number 1, number 2)”. This will return the largest of the two numbers, and is useful as there is no payout when the bill (represented by the forward price) is less than the expected forward plus one standard deviation.    Add up the expected payouts for each month – this is the expected payout per 6-month policy.        Based on your calculations in the spreadsheet, you go to the County Commission meeting and share that your firm can sell this insurance policy for about \/$6 for a 6-month policy, or about $1 per month. The residents feel that sounds reasonable, and the County approves the permit.  A couple of years later, after the Data Center is built, the underwriters adapt your pricing model. They end up charging a significantly higher premium than you anticipated. The lowest quintile of income earners in the community cannot afford the policies, and their electric bills have increased dramatically. Some community non-profits, like the local homeless shelter, also cannot afford the policies.  When you look into this, you find that the underwriters used electric forward rates for areas where there already is an AI data center, which they state are much more accurate for the community’s circumstances.  Review the SOA Code of Professional Conduct . Where do you see an ethical issue? Who was responsible? What should be done? What would you do?      Write a brief paper responding to your findings and addressing each of the questions.     Footnotes    These prices are actually based on historical data for 2025 accessed from the US Energy Information Administration , and the average amount of energy consumption for a US household in 2022 according to the same agency.    One of the things missing from this pricing model is probability, which is covered in another course.     "

  "title": "Interest Rate Risk",
  "body": " Interest Rate Risk  As we have seen, the present value of cash flows can change when the interest rate changes. There is the opportunity that the value will increase, and the risk that the value will decrease. In this introductory activity, we will focus on bonds.    What happens to the price of a bond when the yield rate increases? What happens when the yield rate decreases?      Consider a ten-year zero-coupon bond with face value of 1000. It was purchased to yield 1%. Three years later, interest rates rose to 10%. What happened to the value of the bond? How was the bondholder effected by the rise in interest rates? Explain specifically.      Suppose you have a coupon bond with face value of 10,000 and 4% semiannual coupon bonds for 5 years. It was purchased to yield 3%.    One year after purchase, the yield rates have risen to 5%. Find the book and the market value of the bond, and express the difference as either a gain or a loss to the bondholder.    Suppose instead that one year after the purchase, yield rates have fallen to 2%. Find the book and the market value of the bond, and express the difference as either a gain or loss to the bondholder.     Riding the yield curve is an expression to mean purchasing a bond and waiting for the change in the yield curve over time to produce a profitable environment to sell the bond.    Suppose a three-year bond has 6% annual coupons on 1000 of face value, with a redemption amount of 1200. At the time the bond is issued, the yield curve was:             1  5.350%    2  6.025%    3  6.700%       Find the purchase price when the bond is issued.    Suppose after 1 year, the yield curve is and (pay close attention to the notation -- we are sitting at time 1 right now). Find both the book and market values of the bond.    Suppose 1 year later, the yield curve includes . Find both the book and market values of the bond.    What happened to the investment?

  "body": " Macaulay Duration  Frederick Macaulay, an economist, published in 1938 an extensive study of interest rate behavior going back to 1865. In his book, Some Theoretical Problems Suggested by the Movement of Interest Rates , Macaulay introduced a measurement of interest rate risk that has since become known as Macaulay duration (or just duration ). While there is some variation in the notation, we will denote Macaulay duration by .    This example is due to Broverman. Consider a 10-year loan of 100 with an effective annual interest rate of 10%. Compare the following two payback schedules:    Schedule 1: Pay the entire balance with interest ( ) at the end of the 10-year term.    Schedule 2: Pay back the principal of 100 at the end of the first year, and pay all of the accumulated interest at the end of the 10-year term (which, in this case, amounts to 23.60).      Which one of these is \"longer\"? If we think about the payments as weights at their relative points on the timeline, which would have a later \"center of gravity\"? Explain.    Which one of these schedules would subject the lender to greater interest rate risk? Why?    The Macaulay duration is going to be a weighted average. What do you think we are going to average? What do you think the weights might be?    Suppose we have a set of cash flows at times . The Macaulay duration is the weighted average of the times . The weight for is the present value of cash flow , relative to the present value of the entire cash flow stream.    For each of the following cash flows, estimate whether the duration will be (i) closer to the beginning of the term, (ii) somewhere in the middle of the term, or (iii) closer to the end of the term. Do not perform any calculations, just select one of the three options. Justify your estimation.

Suppose an investor has a portfolio consisting of investments (or just cash flows) of .

Over 90% of mortgages in the US are structured this way, but not all.

In this activity, we'll consider the advantages and disadvantages of ARMs and think about how to communicate them ethically to the public.

Let's start by looking at a Federal Reserve website about which borrowers tend to choose ARMs . Describe a situation where someone would prefer an ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage.    Now let's look at the information on this CFPB website about these two types of mortgage . What are some of the factors that you think should be communicated to the potential borrower as clearly as possible?      Often, in the US, the structure of an ARM is given in terms of two lengths of time: the period that the initial interest rate will apply to and the frequency at which the interest rate will be recalculated thereafter. For instance, a 10y\/6m ARM will have one interest rate that applies for the first 10 years, and the rate will be reset every 6 months thereafter.  Let's say that we have 4 borrowers, all of whom borrow $328,000 on a 30-year mortgage. Each of them will make monthly payments according to the following interest chart.     Borrower  Initial Effective Rate  Type of Mortgage    A  6.000%  fixed rate    B  5.875%  ARM, 10y\/6m    C  5.625%  ARM, 7y\/6m    D  5.500%  ARM 5y\/6m       How much will the first payment of each of these borrowers be?    How much will Borrowers B, C, and D still owe at the end of their initial rate terms (10, 7, and 5 years, respectively)?    The standard adjustment cap for an ARM is 5%. Suppose Borrowers B, C, and D's interest rates all increase by 5% after their initial terms and then hold steady at this rate for the remainder of the loan. What will their new payments be?    Calculate the duration for each of these borrowers.    Interpret these calculations for a potential borrower seeking advice on types of mortgages.      You are working for a mortgage broker, and you have been asked to create the text for a 1-page flyer explaining the advantages and disadvantages of ARMs for their clients. You may wish to start by looking at the CFPB website given at the beginning of this activity.    Now let’s do a stakeholder analysis. In this case, let's just consider the borrowers and the mortgage brokers. Try to see the situation through the eyes of all possible stakeholders.  Test your options by determining how the stakeholders you identified are harmed or benefited when the customer selects a fixed-rate mortgage or an ARM. Test these options by filling in the following tables.     Stakeholder  Harms  Benefits                     Create the text for this flyer. Consider how you can effectively and ethically convey this information to potential borrowers.      Finally, reflect on your decision. What factors did you choose to emphasize? Look back at the ethical lenses from Santa Clara University. Which lens(es) best fit your list of harms and benefits? Was that the same or different from your opinion at the beginning of this activity? Does that surprise you? Why or why not?

However, it is not always possible to perform exact matching. When exact matching is not possible, we identify investments whose payoffs have the same present value as our liabilities, and this may involve interest rate risk. Selecting our assets in a way to minimize or eliminate interest rate risk is called immunization .  The present values of both the liabilities and the assets funding the liabilities are functions of the effective interest rate . For assets, denote this function by , and for liabilities denote the function by . To derive immunization conditions, we are going to define an intermediate function :   The interest rate in effect at time 0 is denoted .    Let's start with an example. The Lucia Seaside Motel has a liability of 2000 due at the end of year 4. They intend to fund this liability with a zero-coupon bond with face value of 604.68 payable at the end of year 2 and a zero-coupon bond with face value 1400 payable at the end of year 5 (the face value amounts have some round-off error). The interest rate at this time is .    Show that (up to round-off error). This is called present value matching and ensures that the assets can fund the liability.

Identify a condition on that is sufficient for to be a global minimum of (you do not have to prove or justify this -- a proof requires real analysis).    Full immunization can be difficult to verify. We are only going to consider one way full immunization can be achieved. We will show that if there is exactly one liability at time , and zero-coupon bonds with face values coming due at time and coming due at time , with satisfying the conditions of Redington immunization, then the liability is full immunized.    Let's see why this is true. First, consider the general case with several liabilities and several assets. Let be the Macaulay duration of the portfolio of liabilities.    Show that the duration condition of Redington immunization implies that is also the duration of the portfolio of assets.    Show that regarding the convexity condition:     Now suppose we have a single liability at time in the amount . This is equivalent to owing a zero-coupon bond. What is ?    Show that if our liability portfolio has a single liability of amount we have assets consisting of exactly two zero-coupon bonds, with face values coming due at time and coming due at time (neither nor equal ), then the convexity condition is satisfied for all .    Show that if there is exactly one liability at time , and zero-coupon bonds with face values coming due at time and coming due at time , with satisfying the present value and duration matching conditions of Redington immunization, then the liability is full immunized (you may have to skip a couple of details near the end of your work).    Note that our argument did not use the condition (except to the extent that and ). This condition is required for and to be positive (otherwise they would not be assets). The nicest way to see why this is true is to use some linear algebra -- see the challenge question at the end of this activity.    A single liability of 250,000 will come due at the end of year 8. To immunize these liabilities at , the firm purchases a zero coupon bond of amount maturing at time and a second zero-coupon bond of amount maturing at time .

  "title": "Ethics Case Study: Reinsurance and Catastrophe Bonds",
  "body": " Ethics Case Study: Reinsurance and Catastrophe Bonds  In this chapter, we have looked at simple models for reserving. Reserving is a major part of an insurer’s strategy for making sure they have the assets to pay claims as they come due. Insurers also include plans for unusually large claims, often through risk transfer . Risk transfer is a process by which a financial risk is taken on by another person or organization for a price. Standard insurance is a form of risk transfer.  Typically, the transfer of risk for rare and very large claims involves something called reinsurance. When it comes to property and casualty insurance, there are also catastrophe bonds for events such as Category 5 hurricanes or significant wildfires. In this case study, we will describe what these are, read a note about the reinsurance and catastrophe bond markets, and evaluate these options ethically using our ethical reasoning skills.  Let’s start with reinsurance. Reinsurance is an insurance policy sold to insurance companies that reimburses the insured for claims in excess of a set amount. Reinsurance policies are available from firms that specialize in the product, such as Swiss RE.   Catastrophe bonds are another form of risk transfer, where the risk is taken on by investors. When a catastrophe bond is issued, the funds raised by the issuer are placed in a special, isolated, interest-bearing account. Coupon payments include income on the funds plus a premium paid by the issuer. If the event insured against occurs (the trigger event ), the raised funds are released to the issuer and the investors lose their investment. Otherwise, at the end of the term, the funds are returned to the investors as a redemption payment. This is kind of like crowdsourced insurance.    Read the note published by IRMI, the International Risk Management Institute . What do you think of the note? How would you describe the tone?      Let’s evaluate reinsurance and catastrophe bonds using ethical reasoning.    Start with an ethical lens. Revisit the Markkula Center’s website and review the six ethical lenses . Based on the decisions you have made in the ethical case studies in this book, which lens do you think fits you best? Why?    With your selected lens in mind, identify at least one ethical issue related to either reinsurance or catastrophe bonds (or both). Explain.    Describe the benefits and harms to stakeholders based on the ethical issue you identified.    What are some alternative actions that could be taken to address the ethical issue you identified? How do these choices mitigate the harms you identified? How do they preserve the benefits you identified? Do they introduce any new harms or benefits to stakeholders?    After evaluating options, decide on a course of action and justify your decision.    Reflect on the decision – does it match the ethical lens you selected? Why or why not?      Write and submit    A memo recommending and justifying your decision (be sure to identify the issue you noted!),    A reflection that describes what lens you selected and how your decision does or does not match your choice    A brief discussion what you have learned about ethical reasoning in this course.

The values recorded are based on the original rate used to price the asset, and these are called book values (sometimes denoted ). The market value (sometimes denoted ) is what we could sell those assets for at the market rate of interest, and therefore come from valuing using the market rate of interest.

If is the present value and is the future value after periods, the effective periodic yield rate satisfies:   If instead of a present value, you have, say, an annuity with level payments , then the yield rate satisfies:   In this case, these amounts are actually received by the investor (or contributed by the investor).  In contrast, the internal rate of return is the rate used to value cash streams, whether or not that is actually realized by the investor. For example, when a loan involves level payments based on an interest rate of , we have   The interest rate is the internal rate of return. This is the interest rate in the loan agreement, and defines how the payments are valued.  If payments received by an investor are reinvested (in a savings account or a sinking fund, for example), the rate earned on the reinvestment account is, simply enough, the reinvestment rate .  The internal rate of return is defined for the given cash flows (more on that later in this chapter). The reinvestment rate determines the yield rate.    Let's look at this with an example. Suppose we have a 10-year loan of 10,000. The borrower is charged an interest rate of 5%. For each of the following repayment and reinvestment options, find (i) the internal rate of return, (ii) the reinvestment rate, and (iii) the yield rate.    The loan is paid off with annual level payments. Payments are reinvested at 5%.    The loan is paid off with annual payments of interest, with the principal paid back with the final interest payment. Payments are reinvested at 5%.    The loan is paid off with a single payment (accumulated interest plus principal) at the end of the term.      Redo each part of , but assume payments are reinvested at 3%.      What do you notice?      In the following exercises, identify or calculate (i) the internal rate of return, (b) the reinvestment rate, and (c) the yield rate.    A lender loans a borrower 11,500 at . The borrower will repay the loan with quarterly level payments for 10 years. Payments will be reinvested in a savings account with an effective quarterly interest rate of 2%.    An investor purchases a bond with face value of 10,000, a coupon rate of 8%. The bond will be redeemed at par in 6 years and is priced to yield 7%. Coupon payments will be deposited into a savings account earning .    There is another, related way, to value an annuity such as a loan. If an investor pays for a series of level payments of , they can obtain a yield rate with each payment while recovering principal in a sinking fund with interest rate . They do so by taking out of each payment for their own consumption, and depositing the rest in the sinking fund. In this case, is the yield rate and is the reinvestment rate (while the internal rate of return still equates with the present values of the payments ).    Suppose a loan has ten annual payments of 1,000 and immediately sold to an investor. The investor pays a price which allows him to yield 4% and recover their principal investment in a sinking fund bearing an effective annual interest rate of . How much should they pay for the loan?      Do you need a formula for the price to pay for such an investment? If you want one, derive one. If you do not, explain how you will solve problems involving recovery of principal through sinking funds.      For the following problem, we will write all parts of the problem, and leave you the rest of this page and the next to solve each part.  Jones buys from Smith the right to receive 20 annual payments of 1000 each beginning 1 year hence.    In their discussion regarding this transaction, Smith and Jones consider three ways of determining the amount Jones must pay to Smith. Find this amount according to each of the following approaches:    The present value at     A price to yield Jones an annual return of 12% while recovering his principal in a sinking fund earning an annual rate of 6%    Accumulate the payments at 6% and then find the present value at 12% of that accumulated value.      Jones calculates his annual rate of return a number of different ways. In Jones earns an annual rate of return of 12% for the 20 years. Find his annual yield according to each of the following approaches.    In above, assume that Jones can reinvest the payments at 6% per year; find Jones' average annual compound rate of return based on the accumulated amount after 20 years compared to his initial investment.    Using the amount invested based on the approach in as the present value of the annuity, find the unknown interest rate (internal rate of return).    Assuming that the full 1000 is deposited in the sinking fund at 6%, find the average annual compound rate of return over the 20 years based on the accumulated value of the sinking fund and the initial amount invested in .        An investor makes a single deposit of 10,000 into Fund A for 10 years which earns a 6% effective rate of interest payable directly to the investor each year. During the first 5 years, the interest payments can only be reinvested into Fund B which earns 4% effective over the entire 10-year period. During the second 5 years, the interest payment can only be invested in Fund C which earns 5% effective.    Find the total accumulated value in Funds A, B, and C combined at the end of 10 years.

The value is typically (but not always) the initial investment and will be negative.    Let's start by finding the net cash flow at a given point in time.  A ten-year investment project requires an initial investment of 100,000 at inception and maintenance expenses at the beginning of each year. The maintenance expense for the first year is 3000 and is anticipated to increase 6% each year thereafter. Projected annual returns from the project are 30,000 at the end of the first year decreasing 4% per year thereafter. Find the net cash flow in year 6, .    The internal rate of return (abbreviated ) is the interest rate that makes the present value of equal to . In other words, it is the value that makes the following equation true:   In this book, unless otherise directed, assume that . The is quoted as an effective rate. For existence and uniqueness questions, see Broverman.    An investor pays 316 for an investment that will pay 150 at time 1 and 200 at time 2. Find the .     🧮 Calculator Corner  For general cash flows, calculating requires solving a polynomial equation, which means (outside of quadratics) we will need numerical methods programmed into our financial calculator.  To find the in our calculator, first go to the cash flows worksheet by pressing CF . For the initial amount , type the value and press ENTER , then press ↓ . For the rest, after you enter , press ENTER and ↓ , then enter the number of times that payment occurs (in a row). So if you have (and is different), enter 1000 for \"C01\" and 2 for \"F01\". Do not forget to hit ENTER after each entry, and type ± after each number for any negative entries.  Once you have entered in all of the cash flows, type IRR  followed by  CPT . The result will be the displayed as a percentage.     Use the financial calculator to repeat . Which do you prefer?      For each of the following cash flows, find the internal rate of return.    An investment costs 1,100 and generates a payment of 500 in one year and 700 in the second year.    An investment costs 912.40, and generates semiannual revenues of 50 for ten years, with an additional 1000 added to the final payment of 50.    A related concept is net present value (abbreviated ). This is just the present value of a set of cash flows given a desired rate of return (for our purposes, the word \"net\" adds nothing). In other words, given an interest rate:   Pay attention to the details in that formula!    The following is a graph of net present value against interest rates between 0 and 100% for a given set of cash flows. Identify the on the graph and explain.  Graph of Net Present Value by Interest Rate        🧮 Calculator Corner  The can also be found with our financial calculator. Simply enter the cash flows in the cash flow worksheet. Make sure you enter negative cash flows as negative numbers. Then type NPV , enter an interest rate (as a percentage), hit , and then press CPT .     Suppose an initial investment at time 0 of 11,000 pays out 4,000 at time 1, 5,000 at time 2, and 4,500 at time 3.    Find the at 8%.    Find the at 12%.    Find the .      The is often used to compare investment projects at a desired rate of return.    Which would you select, a project with a higher or a lower ? Why?    Would you ever select a project with a negative ? Why or why not?      For each of the following sets of investments, calculate the net present value at the desired return rate and determine which investment to select.    The Mines of Moria cost 125,000. They are expected to yield annual revenues of 15,000 for five years, 12,000 for five more years, and 10,000 for two more years. The Mountain of Erebor costs 200,000 and is expected to yield annual revenue of 18,000 for ten years and 12,500 for five years. You want an annual return of 5%.    The Kingdom of Rohan is for sale for 500,000, and is expected to yield annual revenues of 125,000 for four years, and another 75,000 for two more years. The Kingdom of Gondor can be purchased for 1,250,000 and will yield revenues of 200,000 for seven years and 150,000 for three more years. You want an annual return of 7.5%.

  "title": "Time-Weighted Rates of Return",
  "body": " Time-Weighted Rates of Return  In the last activity, we saw how to find rates of return for any set of cash flows. Those cash flows were not invested, but rather income from investments. For the rest of this chapter, we are going to look at determining rates of return in investment funds, particularly when there is account activity such as deposits and withdrawals. The goal is to determine how much return was due solely to the fund itself, and not to the account activity.  There are two approaches to measuring this rate of return. The time-weighted rate of return measures compound growth rate, while the dollar-weighted (sometimes called money-weighted ) rate of return measures simple growth. We start with the time-weighted rate of return.  Note that the funds may not be savings accounts or bonds -- they could be accounts such as mutual funds, that can rise or fall. So you will see some negative growth rates in the activities, exercises, and problems.    We begin with the following example of account balances and activity:     Date  Balance Before Activity  Deposit  Withdrawal    January 1, 1999  100        July 1, 1999  125  20      October 1, 1999  110    10    December 31, 1999  125           Let's start by making a timeline for this account. Record in your timeline the balances and the activity for each date.  In addition, mark rates of return between consecutive dates in the form where in order. You can assume each is effective for the given period.    The time-weighted rate of return is the equivalent effective annual rate that takes us from the beginning of the period to the end (in this case, Jan. 1 to Dec. 31 for one year). This rate only captures the changes due to interest or other investment growth decay.  Using this concept, find an equation for in terms of , , and .    Our goal is to capture growth or decay that comes from the investment, NOT from the deposits and withdrawals.  To calculate , does it make sense to use balances before or after the deposit\/withdrawal? What about and ? Explain your reasoning.    Calculate , , and .    Calculate , the time-weighted rate of return.      Let's try another example.  Find the time-weighted rate of return for the following:     Date  Balance Before Activity  Deposit  Withdrawal    January 1  200,000        August 1  215,000    5000    December 31  205,000             Now we will try to derive formulas by mimicking our calculations. Let us generalize our account and activity using the following table where there are time periods:     Time  Balance Before Activity  Net Contribution                                                                                             Explain what is meant by net contribution.     State precisely what the variable and stand for.    Find a formula for (between time and ). Be careful!!    Write a formula for in terms of with .     NOTE: This is how we usually write the formula for the time-weighted rate of return: we just write the last two formulas.    Use the formula to find the time-weighted rate of return for the account:     Date  Balance Before Activity  Deposit  Withdrawal    January 1  75,000        May 1  67,500  10,000      December 31  90,000             As usual, we can always switch what is known and what we have to find, as in the following exercise:  For the account activity in the following table, the time-weighted return is 0.588%. Find .     Date  Balance Before Activity  Deposit  Withdrawal    January 1  1,000,000        March 1  950,000    X    December 31  900,000           So far, we have assumed we are looking at account balances and activity over 1 year. We can do the same over multiple years -- just remember that the rate is supposed to be an annual rate and compounds over the multiple years. This will be necessary in the following problem (be sure to pay close attention to the details here!).    The details regarding fund value, contributions and withdrawals from a fund are as follows:       Date  Amount    Fund Values:  1\/1\/15  1,000,000      7\/1\/15  1,310,000      1\/1\/16  1,265,000      7\/1\/16  1,540,000      1\/1\/17  1,420,000            Contributions:  6\/30\/15  250,000    Received:  6\/30\/16  250,000            Benefits:  12\/31\/15  150,000    Paid:  12\/31\/16  150,000     Find the effective annual time-weighted rate of return for the two-year period of 2015 and 2016.      An investor deposits 50 in an investment account on January 1. The following summarizes the activity in the account during the year:     Date  Value Immediately Before Deposit  Deposit    March 15  40  20    June 1  80  80    October 1  175  75     On June 30, the value of the account is 157.50. On December 31, the value of the account is . Using the time-weighted method, the equivalent effective annual yield for the first 6 months is equal to the (time-weighted) effective annual yield during the entire 1-year period. Calculate .      Is the formula for the time-weighted rate of return useful or a distraction? Why?    "

  "body": " Dollar-Weighted Rates of Return  In the last activity, we measured the compound rate of return (time-weighted rate of return) on a fund that had its own growth (or decay) in addition to deposits and withdrawals. In this activity we look at the dollar-weighted rate of return. This is an attempt to approximate the rate of growth or decay (due solely to the investment) using simple interest.  Recall that the future value equation for simple interest is In our problems, will be between 0 and 1.  The dollar-weighted (money weighted) rate of return is the simple interest rate that, given a starting balance and a sequence of deposits and withdrawals, results in the given ending balance.    As in the last activity, we begin with an example:     Date  Balance Before Activity  Deposit  Withdrawal    January 1,1999  100        July 1, 1999  125    10    October 1, 1999  110  20      December 31, 1999  125           Start with the initial balance. Write an expression for the value at of the initial balance, using our desired rate .    Consider now the withdrawal of 10 on July 1. Because we withdrew this amount, it did not earn interest. Over how much time did the investor miss out on this interest? Write an expression for the value of the withdrawal that is not part of the final balance.    Now consider the deposit of 20 on October 1. This amount did earn interest. Over how much time did the investor earn interest on this amount? Write an expression for the value of the deposit that is part of the final balance.    The final balance is 125. Put your answers together to write an equation that would result in the final balance of 125, if only we knew .     CAREFULLY keep track of your steps as you solve for . Be pedantic - we want to mimic these steps to write formulas.      Try another example: Find the dollar-weighted rate of return for a fund with the following activity:     Date  Balance Before Activity  Deposit  Withdrawal    January 1  350,000        June 1  300,000    25,000    December 31  360,000             Now let's mimic our steps to derive a formula.  First, let be the beginning balance and let be the ending balance. Let be the net contribution at time , and define:     The total amount of interest (or growth, or decay) in the account is . Express in terms of , , and .    Letting denote our dollar-weighted yield rate (and recalling that this is an approximation with simple interest!), write an expression for the value of at time .    For the contribution at time , for how long does this contribution earn interest at the simple rate (where \"earn\" is suitably interpreted if )?    Use your answers to write an equation that uses , each , each , and to get the final balance .    Solve your equation for . At some point, rewrite in terms of .      Let's solve an exercise using the formula. Find the dollar-weighted rate of return for a fund with the following activity:     Date  Balance Before Activity  Deposit  Withdrawal    January 1  50,000        October 1  60,000  5,000      December 31  72,000             Let's solve an exercise where we switch what is given and what we are looking for.  For an account with activity as in the following table, the dollar-weighted return is 5.714%. Find .

If 200 is added to the fund at the end of three months and if 300 is withdrawn from the fund at the end of nine months, the dollar-weighted rate of return is 4%. Find the ending balance.      Does the formula for the dollar-weighted rate of return help, or is it a distraction?    "

For each of the following sets of investments, calculate the net present value at the desired return rate and determine which investment to select.    The Mines of Moria cost 125,000. They are expected to yield annual revenues of 15,000 for five years, 12,000 for five more years, and 10,000 for two more years. The Mountain of Erebor costs 200,000 and is expected to yield annual revenue of 18,000 for ten years and 12,500 for five years. You want an annual return of 5%.    The Kingdom of Rohan is for sale for 500,000, and is expected to yield annual revenues of 125,000 for four years, and another 75,000 for two more years. The Kingdom of Gondor can be purchased for 1,250,000 and will yield revenues of 200,000 for seven years and 150,000 for three more years. You want an annual return of 7.5%.    The Shire is available for 75,000 and will yield revenues of 20,000 at the end of the first year, 19,000 at the end of the second year, and so on until the end of the sixth year.

Revenues from Rivendell are expected to be 20,000 annually for four years, followed by two more years of 15,000 in revenue, and one final year of 10,000 in revenue. You expect a minimal return of 2.5%.    The Two Towers are real fixer-uppers. The Tower of Orthanc will cost 225,000. While the exterior is in good shape, the interior work necessary to bring the tower up to code will cost an additional 75,000 by the end of the first year of the investment. Starting at the end of year 2, the tower will yield annual revenues of 35,000 over eight years, 25,000 annually over the following two years, and 10,000 annually for two more years. Barad-Dur, on the other hand, needs to be rebuilt from scratch. The real estate will only cost 10,000. However, construction will cost an additional 190,000 spread out evenly over the first two years of the investment. Once completed, the tower will provide 27,500 annually for ten years.

Find his annual yield according to each of the following approaches.    In part (a)(i) above, assume that Jones can reinvest the payments at 6% per year; find Jones'average annual compound rate of return based on the accumulated amount after 20 years compared to his initial investment.    Using the amount invested based on the approach in (a)(ii) as the present value of the annuity, find the unknown interest rate (internal rate of return).

  "title": "Variable Interest Rates",
  "body": " Variable Interest Rates  A loan, or other financial instrument, may have varying interest rates. A common example are \"adjustable rate mortgages\" -- home loans in which the interest rate varies throughout the term of the loan. These varying rates are called floating rates .  Often, floating rates are pegged to a standard interest rate index. In this sense, they will be quoted as the index plus some amount, such as prime + 1.5% (the addition is in terms of percentage points). The most common indices we will see are the prime rate and LIBOR.  The prime rate is an interest rate the U.S. commercial banks charge their most credit-worthy borrowers.  The acronym LIBOR stands for London Inter-Bank Overnight Rate and is a UK-based interest rate that banks charge one another to loan funds overnight (quoted as an effective annual rate most of the time).  There is one last term used in this context - basis points. A basis point (abbreviated bp) is one percent of 1% interest. So 100 bp = 1%. In this case, to say that the floating rate on a loan is LIBOR + 200 bp is the same as saying the floating rate is LIBOR + 2%.    Suppose an adjustable rate mortgage calls for an interest rate of \"prime + 150 bp\" to be determined annually. This means that, assuming monthly payments, they will only change the interest rate every 12 payments.  During the first five years of the loan, the prime rate was as follows:     Year  Prime Rate    1  3.45%    2  4.12%    3  2.95%    4  3.60%    5  3.71%     Find the interest rate (as an effective annual rate) paid by the borrower in each of the first five years of the mortage.      A borrower took out a loan for 10 million to be repaid by five years of annual interest payments with the principal paid off with the final interest payment. The interest is paid at an annual rate of LIBOR + 2%. Over the five years, the LIBOR was as reported in the table below.     Year  LIBOR    1  4.25%    2  5.00%    3  4.75%    4  4.15%    5  3.95%     Find the interest payment each year.      What is the advantage to the borrower of a floating rate? What is the disadvantage? Why might a borrower find floating rates undesirable?    "

  "title": "The Basic Swap Transaction",
  "body": " The Basic Swap Transaction  Borrowers avoid the uncertainty that comes with floating rate loans by contracting with a third party, or a counterparty , who pays the floating rate interest payments to the borrower in exchange for the borrower paying them regular interest payments at a fixed rate. The fixed rate is called the swap rate . In the context of an interest rate swap, the borrower is called the payer and the counterparty is called the receiver . The payments made from the payer to the receiver are called the fixed payments while those in the opposite direction are called floating payments . The floating payments are then made by the payer back to the lender for their interest payments.  A visual depiction of the transaction is:   Schematic diagram of a basic swap transaction.    Of course, it would be silly for the payer and receiver to exchange the same amount. They typically just make a net payment. For example, if the floating payment is 600 and the fixed payment is 500, the receiver just pays the payer 100. Then the receiver pays the lender 600, but that includes the 100 the receiver paid.  There are some other vocabulary terms we need that come along with this transaction:    The swap rate is the fixed rate at which the payer makes fixed payments to the receiver.    The notional amount is the amount to which the rate is applied (so the payer pays to the receiver). For now, think of this as the principal amount of the original loan.    The swap term , also called the swap tenor , is the length of time during which the swap is in effect.    The settlement dates are the dates when payments are exchanged between payer and receiver.    The settlement period is the time between settlement dates.    The driving question in this chapter is how to calculate the swap rate , but for this section, we will focus on making sense of the underlying transaction. We will calculate swap rates in .    Bye Felicia Inc. wants to borrow 12 million at a constant interest rate. Woman Yelling at Cat Bank will loan Bye Felicia 12 million, but at a variable rate. In order to make this work, Bye Felicia reaches out to Kermit Drinking Tea Corp., for whom this transaction may be none of their business, but decides to enter into an interest rate swap contract.  Identify the payer, receiver, and notional amount in this transaction.      Bye Felicia Inc. and Kermit Drinking Tea Corp. enter into a 3-year interest rate swap with payments exchanged every 6 months, starting six months from today. Identify the swap term, the settlement dates, the settlement periods, and the swap tenor. Display each of these on a single timeline.      Woman Yelling at Cat Bank loans Bye Felica Inc. 12 million with interest paid annually at LIBOR. Bye Felicia and Kermit revise their interest rate swap agreement to make annual payments, with a swap rate set at 6.9548%. Suppose the LIBOR in year 1 was 6.12%, in year 2 was 7.04%, and in year 3 was 5.95%.  Find the net payment between Felicia and Kermit each year, and indicate who made the payment to whom.    The receiver has what is called the fixed leg of the interest rate swap, meaning they receive the fixed payments. The payer has the floating leg .    On April 1, 1994, Great Savings Bank had issued many fixed-rate CDs, and had loaned out much of the money it obtained from these at variable rates. The board of directors is concerned that the Bank faces too much interest-rate risk and decides to take the \"fixed leg\" in a fixed-for-floating interest rate swap -- that is, lock in a fixed rate. The notional balance is 35,000,000, the fixed rate is , and the floating rate is the three-month LIBOR. The swap is for one year and the LIBOR rates, given as nominal annual rates, turn out to be 4.250% for the period beginning 4\/01\/1994, 4.875% for the period beginning 7\/01\/94, 5.688% for the period beginning 10\/01\/94, and 6.328% for the period beginning 1\/01\/95. Determine the amount and time of all payments.      Company ABC has an existing debt of 2,000,000 on which it makes annual payments at an annual effective rate of LIBOR plus 0.5%.  ABC decides to enter into a swap with a notional amount of 2,000,000 on which it makes annual payments at a fixed annual effective rate of 3% in exchange for receiving annual payments at the annual effective LIBOR rate.  The annual effective LIBOR rates over the first and second years of the swap contract are 2.5% and 4.0% respectively.  ABC does not make or receive any other payments.  Calculate the net interest payment that ABC makes in the second year.      Why would a counterparty enter into an interest rate swap as a receiver? What are they betting? In what way does an interest rate swap resemble an insurance contract?    "

Recall that this is the fixed rate at which the payer makes payments, while the receiver uses floating rates.  At time 0, we will use the yield curve to find present values, and we use the implied forward rates as estimates of the floating rates that the receiver will pay. We will denote with the simpler . But recall that individual problems may have their own notation -- use context.    Suppose the yield curve is:     Term   Spot Rate     1  3.00%    2  4.50%    3  5.00%    4  5.25%     A payer and receiver enter into a 4-year interest rate swap with annual payments and notional amount . We will use the yield curve to find the swap rate .    What is the amount of the annual fixed payment (in terms of and )?    What is the present value of the fixed payments (in terms of and )?    The floating payments will be based on the forward rates. Find the forward rates, then find the amount of each of the four floating payments (in terms of ).    Find the present value of the floating payments (in terms of ).    Why must the present values of the two legs be equal? (You do not have to be very specific here.)    Set your present values equal and solve for .    What happened to the notional amount? What does that tell you?      Mimic your work in the last problem and derive a formula for the swap rate in an -period interest rate swap, using spot rates and forward rates .      We can make this formula a little nicer using \"telescoping sums.\"    Consider the following sum:   Without converting to decimals or improper fractions, simplify this sum by canceling. This is an example of a telescoping sum (it shortens up like a telescope!).    Recall that we derived the following equation for a forward rate (solved for the rate itself):   Using this formula for the forward rate, rewrite and simplify the present value of the floating payments in an interest rate swap. Notice you will find a telescoping sum!    Use this simplification to rewrite your formula for the swap rate .      Find the swap rate from using your new formula. Which do you prefer?      Recall that given a yield curve, the at-par yield rate of a coupon bond is the coupon rate at which the bond is priced at-par, i.e. its price equals its redemption amount. Using the yield curve in , find the at-par yield rate for a bond with redemption amount . What do you notice?      Sometimes the information we are given may alter our approach to a problem.    Josh and Phillip enter into a four year swap with a notional amount of 200,000. The swap has annual settlement periods. Under the swap, Josh will pay Phillip the fixed swap rate at the end of each year while Phillip will pay Josh the variable rate where the variable rate is the one year spot rate at the beginning of each year.

  "body": " Variations on Interest Rate Swaps  In the last activity, we used several assumptions in calculating the swap rate for an interest rate swap. In this activity, we look at what happens when we relax some of those assumptions. Specifically, we are going to look at the following variations (separately):    The yield curve is given in terms of nominal rates.    The swap transaction does not begin immediately.    The notional amount is not constant.    Our findings from the last activity will change. The basic principle remains -- we set the present values of the two legs equal to one another and solve for the swap rate.    Let's start with a yield curve given in nominal rates. Suppose a payer and a receiver enter into an interest rate swap with four payments every six months. The yield curve is given in the following table, where the rates are annual nominal rates convertible semiannually.     Time  Spot Rate    0.5  4.00%    1.0  5.00%    1.5  5.50%    2.0  6.00%       We don't use nominal rates for calculation. What period do we want for our effective rates for this problem? How do we find those effective rates?    Solve the problem.      Next we look at what happens if our swap does not start right away. These are called deferred swaps. Consider the following example from a prior exam:  The table below shows the spot rates for the given lengths of time.     Number of Years  1  2  3  4  5  6    Effective Annual Spot Rate  2.5%  3.1%  3.4%  3.6%  4.0%  4.2%     Calculate the swap rate for a two-year deferred, three-year interest rate swap with settlement at the end of the year.    When are each of the settlement dates?    When should we value each of the payments?    Solve the problem -- remember to go back to first principles!      Sometimes the notional amount is not constant. This may be because there are principal payments on a loan, a loan is a line of credit (which means different amounts are borrowed each period), or the underlying notional amount is contingent on something like future revenues or future expenses.    Suppose we have an interest rate swap with a tenor of periods, notional amounts , spot rates , and implied forward rates . Write an equation that we would solve in order to calculate the swap rate (we are just looking for an initial equation - we do not need to solve it unless you want to).    What happened in that made our equations simpler, that we can no longer apply here?      An accreting swap is an interest rate swap with an increasing notional amount. An amortizing swap is one in which the notional amount is decreasing. For the following accreting and amortizing swaps, use the following yield curve:     Term   Spot Rate     1  5.25%    2  6.00%    3  6.50%    4  6.60%       Suppose the notional amount for a 4-year interest rate swap starts at 200 million and grows by 1.5% each year. Find the swap rate.    Suppose the notional amount for a 4-year interest rate swap starts at 15 million and declines by 2 million each year. Find the swap rate.    In what way were the changes in the notional amount in the last two problems different? How did that impact your problem solving?      Would it be helpful to derive formulas for all of these variations? Why or why not?    "

  "title": "The Market Value of an Interest Rate Swap",
  "body": " The Market Value of an Interest Rate Swap  Now that we know how interest rate swaps work as transactions, and how to find the fixed swap rate, we can ask ourselves about the value. Specifically, once a swap is underway, and the yield curve changes, what is the market value of the swap? Would could one sell the swap for?  To calculate this, we have to reconsider the floating payments in light of the updated interest rates, and then take the present value of both legs and compare.  You might wonder about which leg we are valuing. The two parties -- the payer and the receiver -- have different interests, or positions. The value to one will be the opposite of the value to the other.    A payer and receiver entered into a 3-year interest rate swap in year 0. At that time, the yield curve was:     Term   Spot Rate     1  3.00%    2  2.80%    3  2.75%     One year later, the new yield curve for the following two years is:     Term   Spot Rate     1  2.75%    2  3.50%     Find the market value (per million of notional value) for both the payer's interest and the receiver's interest.    First, find the fixed payments.    Next, find the present value of the remaining fixed payments one year after the swap tenor began.    Find the remaining floating payments one year after the swap tenor began.    Find the present value of the remaining floating payments.    The difference between the present values gives us the market values. Figure out which difference is the value of the payer's interest (or position), and which is the value for the receiver, and calculate both.      Miaoqi and Nui entered into a four year interest rate swap on May 5, 2015. The notional amount of the swap has a level 250,000 for all four years. The swap has annual settlement periods with the first period starting on May 5, 2015.  Under the swap, Miaoqi agreed to pay a variable rate based on the one year spot rate at the beginning of each settlement period. Nui will pay Miaoqi the fixed rate of 4% on each settlement date.  On May 5, 2017, the spot interest rate curve was as follows:     Term   Spot Rate     1  3.8%    2  4.1%    3  4.3%    4  4.5%    5  4.7%     Miaoqi decides that she wants to sell the swap on May 5, 2017.  Calculate the market value of the swap on May 5, 2017, from Miaoqi's position in the swap.      In , we looked at book value and maket value of loans and bonds.

  "body": " Problems     On April 1, 1994, Great Savings Bank had issued many fixed-rate CDs, and had loaned out much of the money it obtained from these at variable rates. The board of directors is concerned that the Bank faces too much interest-rate risk and decides to take the \"fixed leg\" in a fixed-for-floating interest rate swap -- that is, lock in a fixed rate. The notional balance is 35,000,000, the fixed rate is , and the floating rate is the three-month LIBOR. The swap is for one year and the LIBOR rates, given as nominal annual rates, turn out to be 4.250% for the period beginning 4\/01\/1994, 4.875% for the period beginning 7\/01\/94, 5.688% for the period beginning 10\/01\/94, and 6.328% for the period beginning 1\/01\/95. Determine the amount and time of all payments.       On June 1, 1998 Confidence Life and Casualty (CLC) entered into an interest rate swap with Great Commercial Bank (GCB). The swap lasted five years, and had settlement dates at the end of each year. The notional amount was 50,000,000. CLC was assured interest calculated using the one-year LIBOR and was obligated to pay interest at an annual effective rate of 6%. If the five consecutive June 1 LIBOR rates used were 5.940%, 5.803%, 7.214%, 4.055%, and 2.251%, what was the June 1, 2003 total value, calculated using the compound interest accumulation function , of the netted payments that CLC received from the swap?       Company ABC has an existing debt of 2,000,000 on which it makes annual payments at an annual effective rate of LIBOR plus 0.5%.  ABC decides to enter into a swap with a notional amount of 2,000,000 on which it makes annual payments at a fixed annual effective rate of 3% in exchange for receiving annual payments at the annual effective LIBOR rate.  The annual effective LIBOR rates over the first and second years of the swap contract are 2.5% and 4.0% respectively.  ABC does not make or receive any other payments.  Calculate the net interest payment that ABC makes in the second year.       SOA Farms has a 500,000 loan from Bailey Bank. Under the terms of the loan, SOA will pay interest annually to Bailey Bank based on LIBOR plus 120 basis points. Additionally, SOA will pay the principal of 500,000 at the end of five years.  SOA would prefer to know the annual interest cost that will be incurred. To fix the interest rate on the loan, SOA enters into a five-year interest rate swap with a notional amount of 500,000 and annual settlement dates. The terms of the swap are that SOA will make swap payments based on a fixed rate of 5.35% and will receive swap payments based on a variable rate of LIBOR plus 50 basis points.  During the third year of the loan, LIBOR is 5.6%.  Calculate the net interest payment made by SOA at the end of the third year.       Josh and Phillip enter into a four year swap with a notional amount of 200,000. The swap has annual settlement periods. Under the swap, Josh will pay Phillip the fixed swap rate at the end of each year while Phillip will pay Josh the variable rate where the variable rate is the one year spot rate at the beginning of each year.  You are given the following prices for a zero coupon bond that matures for 1 on the maturity date:     Maturity Date  Price    1 year  0.965    2 years  0.920    3 years  0.875    4 years  0.825    5 years  0.770     Determine the net swap payment at the end of the first year.       The term structure for (annual effective) interest rates is as follows for corresponding maturities:     Maturity  Effective Interest Rate    1-year  5%    2-year  10%    3-year  15%    4-year  20%     Find the level fixed swap rate for a 4-year interest rate swap of floating rate interest for fixed rate interest.

If the swap has annual payments, what is the fixed rate you should pay?       You are given the spot rates for a LIBOR yield curve.     Years to Maturity  1  2  3  4    Spot Rate  2.75%  3.00%  3.40%  4.00%     A four year annual interest rate swap with a notional amount of 1,000,000 will enable you to pay a fixed rate and receive 1-year LIBOR. What is the fixed rate?       The yield curve spot rates for three years are given by:   Find the swap rate for a 3-year fixed interest rate swap.       The current spot interest rate curve is as follows:                   .25  .50%  .75  .40%    0.50  1.65%  2.00  2.48%    0.75  1.79%  2.25  2.80%    1.00  1.92%  2.50  3.10%    1.25  2.10%  2.75  3.35%    1.50  2.25%  3.00  2.50%     Rafael has a one-year loan for 1,000,000 with principal paid at the of the one-year period. The loan has a variable interest rate that resets at the beginning of each three month period. The interest rate will be the spot interest rate at the beginning of each three month period.  Rafael enters into an interest rate swap where he is the payer with the characteristics of the swap exactly matching the loan.  Determine the quarterly swap rate that Rafael will pay. Express your answer in basis points.       Suppose the current term structure has effective annual zero coupon bond yields for one, two, and three years of 8%, 9%, and 9.5% respectively. Find the swap rate for a one-year deferred, two-year swap.       The table below shows the spot rates for the given lengths of time.

Under the swap, there is no swapping of interest rates during the first two years. During the last three years, the settlement period will be one year. Under this swap, Tommy will be the payer. The variable interest rate will be based on the one year spot rate at the start of each settlement period.  The notional amount of this swap is 500,000.  Calculate the swap rate for this swap.       Katarina has borrowed 300,000 from Trout Bank. Katarina will repay 100,000 of principal at the end of each of the first three years.  Katarina will pay Trout Bank a variable interest rate equal to the one year spot interest rate at the beginning of each year.  Katarina would like to have a fixed interest rate so she enters into an interest rate swap with Lily. Under the interest rate swap, Katarina will pay a fixed rate to Lily, and Lily will pay a variable rate to Katarina. The variable rate will be the same rate that Katarina is paying to Trout Bank. The other terms of the swap will mirror the loan that Katarina has.  Which of the following statements is true:    This is an accreting swap.    The settlement period for the swap is three years.    The notional amount for this swap is 300,000.    Katarina and Trout Bank are counterparties to the swap.    Lily is the receiver under the swap.         In the scenario in , you are given the following spot interest rates:     Time ( )  Spot Rate ( )    1  4.3%    2  4.6%    3  5.1%    4  5.4%    5  5.6%     Calculate the swap interest rate for Katarina's swap.       Miaoqi and Nui entered into a four year interest rate swap on May 5, 2015. The notional amount of the swap has a level 250,000 for all four years. The swap has annual settlement periods with the first period starting on May 5, 2015.  Under the swap, Miaoqi agreed to pay a variable rate based on the one year spot rate at the beginning of each settlement period. Nui will pay Miaoqi the fixed rate of 4% on each settlement date.  On May 5, 2017, the spot interest rate curve was as follows:     Time ( )  Spot Rate ( )    1  3.8%    2  4.1%    3  4.3%    4  4.5%    5  4.7%     Miaoqi decides that she wants to sell the swap on May 5, 2017.  Calculate the market value of the swap on May 5, 2017, from Miaoqi's position in the swap.       Suppose at time 0, the term structure has effective annual zero coupon bond yields for one, two, and three years of 8%, 9%, and 9.5% respectively. A borrower has a three-year, interest-only loan of amount 1,000,000 with floating interest payments to be paid at the end of each year. The borrower arranges a swap allowing the borrower to pay fixed interest at the appropriate swap rate. One year later, the term structure has a one-year effective interest rate of 9% and annual effective rate of 9.5% for two-year maturities. Determine the value of the swap at the end of the first year to the borrower.      The one-year spot rate is 3.10% and the two-year spot rate is 4.59%. Assuming a constant notional amount, the swap rate for a 3-year interest rate swap is 5.17%. Find the three-year spot rate.      The one-year spot rate is 1.08% and the three-year spot rate is 2.96%. Assuming a constant notional amount, the swap rate for a 3-year interest rate swap is 2.925%. Find the two-year spot rate.      We have the following information about the term structure:   Find the swap rate for a 3-year interest rate swap with a constant notional amount.       An interest rate swap is set up for the next two years with swap rate 6.48%. The one-year spot rate is 6%. Find the second year forward rate .       A two-year bond with level annual coupon of 4.2 and maturity value of 100 has price 101.291. The one-year spot rate is 0.045.  What is the swap rate for a two-year interest rate swap?      Suppose we have the following yield curve:     Time ( )  Spot Rate ( )    1  6.0000%    2  6.5000%    3       4       5  8.0000%     Assume constant notional amounts for interest rate swaps.

  "body": " The Components of Interest Rates  In the last activity, we examined how supply and demand determine the risk-free rate, the compensation for deferred consumption. In this activity, we will examine how to modify the risk-free rate to account for a more realistic capital environment.    First, think about what else might impact the interest rate. What risks do we need to address? What else might impact an interest rate? These are the components of an interest rate.      To begin with, we need to figure out how we are going to combine different components into a single rate. Let be the risk-free rate, let be another component of the interest rate, and let be the total interest rate.    Suppose interest compounds continuously. Express in terms of and .    Suppose interest compounds annually. Express in terms of and .    Which is simpler?    Henceforth, for simplicity, we will assume interest compounds continuously. We will also denote the risk-free rate as and the total interest rate as .    One of the major risks that forms a component of interest rates is the risk of default. We let denote this component, and this goes by various names: the default risk premium , the credit spread , or the spread for credit risk .  Suppose a lender makes loans of 1000 for five year terms. For simplicity, assume that loans are paid back as a lump sum at the end of the term. The risk-free rate is .    How much does the lender want to be repaid for each loan?    Suppose we know ahead of time that 3.5% of borrowers will default. Let be the amount the borrower is contractually bound to repay at the end of 5 years. If the lender recovers nothing from borrowers who default, how much do they expect to earn on each loan? Express your answer in terms of .    Use what the lender actually earns and what they want to earn to solve for .    Using your value of , find the total interest rate and the credit spread .      Repeat , but assume that the lender recovers 30% of the contractual payback amount on loans that default.    Another risk that lenders face is the risk of inflation - the reduction in purchasing power of the payments they receive from lenders. If we knew actual inflation each year, , we could just set . But we will not know for certain, and rely on forecasts and predictions.    Sometimes lenders obtain inflation protection on their loans by passing the risk of inflation to the borrower. In this case, they \"pay\" for inflation protection through an interest rate reduction of . The rate is called the real interest rate . The borrower is then required to make their payment as adjusted for inflation. This means . We cannot observe directly, only .  Let's see how this works with a problem.  Porter makes three-year loans that include inflation protection. The annual interest rate compounded continuously that must be paid is 3.2% plus the rate of inflation.  The U.S. government borrows 100,000 for three years from Porter. The actual annual inflation rate during the first year was 2.4% compounded continuously. The actual annual inflation rates for the second and third years respectively was 2.8% and 4.2% compounded continuously.  The U.S. government is considered a risk free borrower, which means there is no chance of default.  Calculate the amount that the U.S. government will owe Porter at the end of three years.      Suppose a borrower takes out a loan of 100,000 and makes interest-only payments for 10 years, after which they pay the principal balance. The lender has inflation protection on the loan.  The payments for the first three years, and actual inflation rate for each year, are as follows:     Year  1  2  3    Payment  3561.97  3303.39  4602.79    Actual Inflation  2%  1.75%  3%     Assume there are no other adjustments to the interest rate.    Find the real interest rate paid by the borrower.    If the rate the bank charges for deferred consumption is , what is the rate paid by the lender for inflation protection?    Interest rates for loans without inflation protection include an additional term for expected inflation and for unexpected inflation . Then . This is called the nominal interest rate .    A bank charges a nominal interest rate of 5% on its loans. Inflation is expected to be 3%, and as a matter of policy, the bank adds 50 basis points to expected inflation to account for error in its expectations. What rate does the bank charge for deferred consumption?      We do not observe , , , or directly, only real and nominal rates.    Recall that the real interest rate is the rate charged to borrowers for loans with inflation protection, and the nominal rate is the rate charged to borrowers without inflation protection. If is the real interest rate and is the nominal interest rate offered at the same bank (so that the value of is the same for both), what is ? Can this quantity be observed?    A bank charges a nominal interest rate of 6.5% on its loans without inflation protection, and a real interest rate of 6% on its loans with inflation protection. If the bank is not concerned with unexpected inflation and pays only a few basis points for inflation protection, what does the bank expect the inflation rate to be over the next few years?      Write equations for the interest rate in an environment with default risk and inflation risk. Write one equation for a real interest rate (a loan with inflation protection), and another equation for a nominal interest rate (without inflation protection).      There is another component of interest rates called the maturity risk premium .    Consider a 3-year bond and a 30-year bond. Which would have a higher yield rate? Why?    Your observation about the 3-year and 30-year bonds is called the maturity risk premium . Explain it more generally.    There are four theories that could explain the maturity risk premium. In each of the following, describe an example.     Market Segmentation Theory - this theory states that there are borrowers and lenders for different term structures, and the supply and demand for loanable funds is not the same for different terms.     Preferred Habitat Theory - this theory states that given enough compensation, a borrower or lender who prefers one term can be convinced to borrow or lend for a different term.     Liquidity Preference\/Opportunity Cost Theory - this theory states that borrowers need to pay higher interest rates to persuade lenders to issue loans for longer terms.     Expectations Theory - this theory states that longer term interest rates reflect the expected shorter term interest rates in the future.        A business is issuing bonds to raise capital for a project with an unusually long term. As a result, they end up paying a higher interest rate on the new issue than they pay on their other bonds. For each of the following explanations, state the corresponding theory of maturity risk premium.    The investors targeted for the issue were concerned about having their funds tied up for a longer period of time.    Their investors typically purchased bonds from the company for shorter periods, and had to be incentivized to invest for a longer-term project.    Investors expected short-term interest rates to rise in the coming years.    The company was marketing the bonds to a class of investors different from those who hold their shorter-term bonds.    The liquidity premium compensates investors for loss in value that could occur while waiting to convert their investments to cash.    McCord Bank offers multiple investment accounts. Withdrawals from a \"Standard Savings Account\" can be made on demand. Withdrawals from a \"Superior Savings Account\" require 7 days to settle (meaning it takes 7 days to obtain your withdrawal), while withdrawals from a \"Premium Savings Account\" require 3 days to settle.  Rank the interest rates on the three accounts from highest to lowest.      Let and be the maturity risk premium and liquidity premium, respectively. Note that, like and , these are not observable. Only the rate is observable. Write equations for the total interest rate, including compensation for risk of default as well as inflation risk, and the maturity risk and liquidity premiums. Write one equation for the real interest rate (with inflation protection) and one for the nominal rate (without inflation protection).    "

  "title": "Interest Rates Components in Context",
  "body": " Interest Rates Components in Context  We are now going to take a closer look at factors that impact interest rates in both savings and lending products. We will first look at commercial banks, then government bonds, and finally corporate bonds.  There are a number of empirical facts that are in the SOA Study Note on Determinants of Interest Rates. These are often tested through questions asking which of several statements are true or false, and the questions could give you a series of statements and your selections could include one or more of the statements.  We will include some of the empirical facts in this activity, but cannot promise that they will be comprehensive. You are strongly encouraged to read the study note carefully (even for the problems in this text).  Let's start with commercial banks. These are the banks where you likely hold deposit accounts, such as a checking account. This is to be distinguished from investment banks (such as Goldman Sachs, for example) which are involved in more sophisticated transactions.    Commercial banks offer two types of products - savings products (on which they pay interest) and lending products (on which they charge interest). How do they make a profit?      There are several factors that influence the interest rate offered or charged by a commercial bank. For each of the following, describe how the factor will impact the rate offered on savings accounts.     Overhead Costs : This factor consists of costs such as rent and utilities for a building.     Business Environment : This factor concerns that market in the region (which could be electronic) where the bank operates.     Business Strategy : This factor concerns the bank's strategic plans for growth.     Perceived Creditworthiness : This factor concerns whether depositors consider the bank to be a credit risk (waiting for FDIC insurance to cover your deposits in the event the bank fails is an inconvenience at best).    The two most common savings products banks offer are savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs). Savings accounts have few withdrawal limitations. Some limit withdrawals to a certain number per month. Others have no limits. For a CD, funds can only be withdrawn at maturity at the end of the term, otherwise the investor will incur a penalty.    Each of the following investors is in a fortunate position of having enough income to cover their household and personal expenses with funds left over. For each, advise them whether to put their excess funds in a savings account or in a certificate of deposit.    One family wants to have an emergency fund that can earn some interest when not needed, but draw on if an unexpected expense occurs or if someone loses their jobs.    Another family wants to put some money away to earn interest in order to make a major purchase in six months.    Let's now turn to loan products.  There are typically three types of loans offered by banks:     Secured Loans are loans backed by some sort of collateral. If a borrower defaults, the collateral can be seized and auctioned off to satisfy the debt. Home loans (mortgages) and car loans are secured.     Guaranteed Loans are loans guaranteed by a third party, such as the U.S. Government. The third party covers the lenders losses in the event the borrower defaults. Student loans are typically guaranteed.     Unsecured Loans do not have any collateral or guarantees. Most credit cards are unsecured.      Answer the following questions about loans.    Consider the interest rates on a secured loan, on a guaranteed loan, and on an unsecured loan. Write down one or more inequalities for these interest rates (assuming everything else about the loan, lender, and borrower are the same). Note that you may not be able to compare every pair (which is why you may have more than one inequality). Explain your thinking.    How would the creditworthiness of a borrower impact the interest rate on a loan?    Security and guarantees are not all equal. Collateral that is in poor condition or guarantees from third parties whose credit is risky are of lower quality than collateral that is in excellent condition or guarantees from the U.S. Government (which is risk-free). How would the quality of the security or of a guarantee impact the interest rate on a loan?      Rank the following credit cards from largest interest rate to smallest.    A credit card issued to a moderately credit-worthy borrower, secured by a cash deposit equal to half of the credit limit.    A credit card issued to a moderately credit-worthy borrower, unsecured.    A credit card issued to a highly credit-worth borrower, secured by a cash deposit equal to the entire credit limit.    A credit card issued to a borrower with no credit history, unsecured.    A credit card issued to a moderately credit-worthy borrower, secured by a cash deposit equal to the entire credit limit.        The prime rate is the interest rate offered to a bank's most creditworthy borrowers. Typically, rates are quoted as \"prime + \" where is quoted in (basis points).    If the prime rate is 4%, what interest rate is equal to \"prime + 75 bp\"?    Rank the following interest rates, from smallest to largest. Assume the prime rate is 3%.    Prime plus 125 bp    Prime plus 1%    4.75%        Poverty can be considered an initial condition, something one may be born into. Compare thinking about poverty as an initial condition with an old saying -- \"it takes money to make money.\"  Describe the role lending and interest rate components may play in reinforcing poverty, making poverty a cyclic condition. What can be done to counteract these forces?    We now turn to government debt (in the form of bonds). Debt issued by a national government is called sovereign debt , whereas debt issued by a political subdivision of a nation (like a state or city) is called municipal debt . Municipal debt is more likely to default than sovereign debt. This is because nations have the power to print money to satisfy their obligations (even though this is inflationary). In addition, some governments are able to link tax receipts to inflation. For example, the marginal income tax rates in the United States are on a schedule for anticipated inflation.    In the United States, sovereign debt takes the form of Treasury Bills (T-Bills), Treasury Notes, and Treasury Bonds. T-Bills have terms of 1 year or less, do not pay coupons, and are valued using simple discount (which we will explore in more depth later). Treasury Notes and Treasury Bonds are valued using semi-annual compound interest and pay semiannual coupons. Treasury Notes have terms of 2 to 10 years, and Treasury Bonds have terms from 10 to 30 years.  In the Unites States, income from T-Bills, Treasury Notes, and Treasury Bonds is taxable at the federal level, not at the state or local level. Municipal bond income in the United States are not taxable at the federal level, but may be at the state level.    Summarize the distinctions between T-Bills, Treasury Notes, and Treasury Bonds in a table.    Families like to invest in U.S. Treasury securities because of their low risk. Determine which type of treasury security each of the following families should invest in (Treasury Bills, Treasury Notes, or Treasury Bonds).    A young family wants to save for retirement.    A family wants to save some excess funds for a purchase to be made in 9 months.    Parents of a 10-year old child want to save for their child's college tuition.      Some Treasury Notes or Treasury Bonds are adjusted for inflation. Nominal Return Bonds are bonds whose coupon payments and maturity payments are fixed at the outset, with no inflation adjustment. Real Return Bonds are bonds where the face value and maturity value are adjusted for inflation. Since the face value is adjusted for inflation, coupon payments are also adjusted for inflation (but the coupon rate remains constant).  Typically, an amount is adjusted for inflation using the CPI. The amount to be adjusted is multiplied by the ratio of the current CPI to some base CPI. For example, if the base CPI is 120, and the current CPI is 132, then the amount is multiplied by 132\/120, or 1.1 (which means 10% inflation between the base year and the current year).  The real return bonds issued by the United States Government are called Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS).    A Treasury Inflation Protected Security is issued with term of 5 years, a face value of 1000 and a coupon rate of 5%. Determine the total amount of the payments made to the borrower in each of the following years (add amounts in the same year without regard for the time value of money) using the following annual CPI values (Year 0 = 100):     Year  1  2  3  4  5    CPI  101.2  96  101.45  102.01  101.67       We now look at municipal bonds. There are two types of municipal bonds. Revenue Bonds are municipal bonds paid back with revenues from a specific project. General Obligation Bonds are municipal bonds paid back from the general fund and are not connected with any specific project.    Identify the type of government bond described.    Governor Eisler and the State of Ferris issue bonds to raise funds to pay for the construction of highways that will charge tolls.    The City of Actuaria issues bonds to raise funds for their general operating expenses.    The federal government issues bonds to pay for the national deficit.      Describe how each of the following factors will impact the price of government debt (equivalently, the interest rate on government debt). In addition, describe distinctions in the impact of the factor between sovereign debt and municipal debt.    Creditworthiness of the borrower.    Tax treatment of the interest payments.    Another factor that can influence the price (and yields) of government bonds is currency fluctuation, as illustrated in .    A U.S. investor purchased a 9-month European bond denominated in Euros. The bond had a face value of 1000 euros, and was priced to yield an effective annual yield of 0.96% (European). The investor purchased the bond on January 1, 2020, when the exchange rate was 1.11 US Dollars per Euro. Nine months later, on October 1, 2020, when the bond matured, the exchange rate was 1.17 US dollars per Euro. Determine the US effective annual yield earned by the investor.    We now turn to corporate bonds .    Corporate bonds are often purchased through intermediaries - brokers - who buy bonds directly from issuers and sell them to investors. Brokers make money by selling the bonds for a higher price than they purchase them. The amount that brokers purchase a bond for is the bid (\"b\"id for `'b\"uy), and the amount they sell a bond for is the ask . The difference, ask - bid, is the bid-ask spread . The bid-ask spread can be expressed as either a price difference or as a yield difference.  The bid-ask spread tells investors something about liquidity. Liquidity is the ability to convert an investment to cash. If brokers expect it to be harder to convert bonds to cash (less liquid), the bid-ask spread will be larger. How will a larger bid-ask spread impact the interest rate on a corporate bond?      Several other factors impact interest rates on corporate bonds. Describe the impact of each of the following:     Rating . Independent agencies (such as Moody's or S&P) rate the creditworthiness of corporate bonds. The highest is AAA.     Seniority . In the event a corporation is liquidated in bankruptcy, some bondholders have a higher claim to the proceeds of the sale. The debt senior bondholders hold is paid off first, whatever is left is available for junior ( subordinated ) bondholders and other debtholders.     Call\/Put Options . As we saw in , some bonds involve call provisions allowing issuers to retire the bond early. Some bonds have put provisions which allow the bondholder to sell the bond back to the issuer.      Rank the interest rates for the following corporate bonds from smallest to largest. Ties are allowed!    Corporation A has a low credit rating. They issue bonds that have a high bid-ask spread and are junior relative to previously issued bonds.    Corporation B has a low credit rating. They issue bonds that have a low bid-ask spread and have seniority over other bond issues.    Corporation C has a high credit rating. They issue bonds with a high bid-ask spread, are senior to other bond issues, and have a call provision.    Corporation D has a high credit rating. They issue bonds with a low bid-ask spread and are senior to other bond issues.        List the factors that impact the interest rates for each of the following:    Savings products offered by commercial banks.    Loans offered by commercial banks.    Government bonds.    Corporate bonds.    "

  "title": "The Role of the Federal Reserve",
  "body": " The Role of the Federal Reserve  In modern economies, central banks play an important role in maintaining a national monetary system. In the United States, the functions of a central bank are handled by the Federal Reserve System (established in 1913). In this section, we will examine the role of central banks in general, and the Federal Reserve in particular.  As with , the Study Note includes a wealth of empirical facts that could be tested. We do not claim that this section is comprehensive in that respect. We recommend you supplement this activity with a careful reading of the study note.  We begin with central banks. Central banks have two main functions -- to facilitate payment systems and to act as a lender of last resort to commercial banks.    Which function of a central bank is represented by the following scenarios?    A commercial bank needs to borrow funds overnight to satisfy demands from savings account holders.    A customer pays for their coffee with a debit card. The customer banks with McCord Bank. The coffee house banks with Morejon Bank. Funds are transferred from McCord Bank's reserve account to Morejon Bank, and funds from McCord Bank are transferred back into their reserve account.      Central banks require every bank in their system to maintain a specific amount of funds in it called the bank's reserve requirement . The account is the bank's reserve .    Come up with at least one reason why banks would have reserve requirements.    The amount of the reserve requirement can change over time. Which of the following are factors that help determine reserve requirements for McCord Bank?    The importance of McCord Bank in the overall payment system.    The Central Bank's need to satisfy demands of individuals (people) who hold savings accounts with them.    The salary of McCord Bank's executive officers.    The volume of transactions performed by McCord Bank.      A bank's reserve can be used for overnight transfer to facilitate payments, but the bank has to make sure their reserve requirement continues to be met.    Suppose a central bank facilitates payments through transfers of reserve requirements. Put the following steps of a payment series in chronological order.    Morejon Bank makes a demand for payment from McCord Bank.    Russel Jackson uses his debit card from McCord Bank to buy groceries from his favorite grocery Washington D.C. grocery store, Stevie's (the store banks with Morejon Bank).    McCord Bank debits Russel Jackson'account and transfers the funds to their reserve at the central bank.    The Federal Reserve transfers funds from the McCord reserve to the Morejon reserve.    McCord Bank transmits a notice to make a payment to Morejon Bank.    The funds are credited to Stevie's account at Morejon Bank.    The funds are transferred to Morejon Bank from their reserve at the central bank.      In their role as lenders of last resort, central banks use reserve accounts as a source of funds. In addition, some central banks (but not all) are authorized to issue currency. In addition to supporting their role as lenders of last resort, the authority for actions such as issuing currency allows the central bank to set monetary policy by controlling the supply of money and setting interest rates. Monetary policy has an impact on inflation and unemployment. In the United States, although the Federal Reserve sets monetary policy, they are not authorized to issue currency. Their tools are less direct (as we will see).    Suppose the statute authorizing the creation of a central bank in the Republic of Actuariastan reads as follows:  The Central Bank of Actuariastan has the following powers:    to establish, maintain, and update the mechanisms for transfers of payments between Registered Banks in the Republic of Actuariastan,    to hold deposits and make payments on behalf of the Republic of Actuariastan,    to facilitate transfers between the Central Bank of Actuariastan and foreign banks,    to lend funds to Registered Banks in the Republic of Actuariastan and to set the interest rate for loans to Registered Banks,    to issue Treasury Bonds, and    to repurchase Treasury Bonds.      Suppose the Central Bank of Actuariastan is concerned that the interest rate is too high and wants to reduce the interest rate. Which of the following strategies are authorized and will reduce the interest rate? Select all that apply.    Issue more currency into the country.    Withdraw currency from the country.    Issue Treasury Bonds.    Purchase Treasury Bonds.    Increase the interest rate charged for loans to other banks.    Reduce the interest rate charged to loans for other banks.      The Central Bank is only authorized to manage mechanisms for transfers of payments between Actuariastan banks. How does the statute envision transactions involving foreign banks will be facilitated?    In the United States, the central bank functions are handled by the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve System is made up of 12 regional banks together with a committee called the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC). The regional banks and the FOMC are governed by the Board of Governors.  The Federal Reserve is authorized to take monetary action to help control inflation and unemployment, but they are not authorized to issue currency. Instead, they set interest rate targets through market activities. The FOMC determines a target rate and the regional banks buy and sell T-Bills in the open market in order to try to achieve that rate.    Sketch a diagram illustrating the components of the U.S. Federal Reserve System.    To be more specific, the Federal Reserve is able to manage two different interest rates. The federal funds rate is the interest rates banks charge one another for overnight loans. Overnight loans will be necessary when reserves fall below their requirement. The FOMC sets federal funds rate targets to be achieved through T-Bill purchases and sales by the regional banks.  The other rate, directly controlled by the Federal Reserve, is the rate at which commercial banks borrow directly from the Federal Reserve. This is called the discount rate and comes from the discount window . Banks prefer to borrow from other banks as it shows that they are creditworthy.    On a given day, the discount rate is 3.65%, the prime rate is 3.55%, the LIBOR is 3.30%, the federal funds rate is 3.25%, and the federal funds target rate is 3.20%.  On the same day, Bank XYZ's reserve balance held at the Federal Reserve is lower than the reserve requirement, and Bank XYZ needs to borrow from those member institutions of the Federal Reserve who have excess funds in their reserve. Let be the rate at which Bank XYZ borrows these excess funds.  Determine .      For each of the following scenarios in the United States, determine which rate is involved.    A bank facing a shortage and unable to borrow from its peers has to borrow from the Federal Reserve.    Due to a concern about a stock market bubble, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City sells bonds in order to increase interest rates.    The Federal Open Market Committee sets targets in order to decrease interest rates in order to increase capital investment.    The Federal Reserve charges a higher rate for loans it makes to other banks.    Morejon Bank borrows funds overnight from McCord Bank in order to satisfy depositor demands for the day.    We conclude by considering how setting the federal funds rate target impacts interest rates in the market.    Suppose the FOMC takes action that increases the federal funds rate.    What does this action do to the cost of falling below reserve requirements for a bank like McCord Bank?    How would a bank like McCord Bank alter its lending decisions in response?    How would this impact the supply and demand of loanable funds, and what is the consequence for the market interest rate?      Suppose the FOMC takes action that decreases the federal funds rate. Following similar logic, describe how this impacts market interest rates.      Summarize the role central banks play in an economy, and what this looks like in the United States.    "

  "body": " Simple Discount  In , we skipped simple discount. It was not necessary until now. U.S. T-Bills quote their rate as a simple discount rate (as opposed to Canadian T-Bills, which quote simple interest rates). This is sensible since simple interest (and discount) is used over short periods of time, and T-Bills reach maturity in less than one year.  Recall that simple interest is linear. We have . Similarly, simple discount is linear. Since discount is backward-looking, we would like to find so that     We begin by \"constructing\" simple interest.  We'll start with an example. Suppose Konstantin Avdonin borrows 100 for a 6-month period with an annual simple interest rate of .    By linearity, what is the rate applied over a 6-month period?    For simple interest, we multiply the six-month rate by and add to to get . Find this amount.    Generalize what you did for Konstantin and derive the simple interest formula for .

  "body": " U.S. T-Bills vs Canadian T-Bills  We will now look at differences between T-Bills in the United States and Canada. Recall that T-Bills are zero-coupon bonds that mature in less than one year. There are two differences between T-Bills in the U.S. and Canada. For U.S. T-Bills, we quote the yield rate as simple discount and use a 360-day year. For Canadian T-Bills, we quote the yield rate as simple interest and use a 365-day year.  Let's fix our notation before we start. Given a T-Bill, whether in the U.S. or Canada, we let be the number of days until maturity, the price (i.e. ), be the maturity value, and be the amount of interest (or discount). In addition, will be the rate of simple discount (in the U.S.) or simple interest (in Canada).    Find a relationship between , , and . This relationship is true in both the U.S. and Canada.      Next we find a formula for the quoted rate on a U.S. T-Bill. In the U.S., the quoted rate is a simple discount rate, and we use a 360-day year.    Write down an equation for .

  "body": " Ethics Case Study -- Audit the Fed  Libertarians and some conservatives often call for legislation to audit the Federal Reserve. While the Federal Reserve is subject to regular internal audits by independent inspectors general, external expert auditors, and more generally is subject to review by the Government Accountability Office, the calls to \"audit the Fed\" are based on seeking greater and more detailed Congressional oversight. In effect, the creation of the central bank took the details of monetary policy out of democratic control. By way of contrast, the details of fiscal policy (such as setting marginal tax rates and the federal budget) are entirely within Congress' control.  You are consulting an independent Senator on the Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2015. The legislation was passed by the House of Representatives, partly as a response to the 2008 financial crisis, and is now before the Senate. You have been asked to consider whether voting for the bill is the ethical course of action.     Step 1 : State the Problem.       Step 2 : Gather the Facts.  Ben Bernanke was chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors from 2006 to 2014. Read his analysis of the bill at . You can read the actual bill (although you might have to chase back references) at . One of the studies Bernanke cites is at , and another (which analyzes the impact of central banking on countries transitioning away from communism) can be accessed at .  Summarize your findings and state your starting position.       Step 3 : Identify stakeholders. Consider both primary stakeholders (directly affected) and secondary stakeholders (indirectly affected). Try to see the situation through the eyes of all possible stakeholders.       Step 4 : Develop options. Be imaginative, avoid dilemmas or yes\/no situations. Instead consider how to modify questions and ask “to\/for whom” or “how much.\"       Step 5 : Test options by determining how the stakeholders you identified are harmed or benefited by an action or inaction. Test at least two options by filling in the following tables. You can add rows for more stakeholders, and make additional tables for more options.   Option 1 :     Stakeholder  Primary or Secondary?  Harms  Benefits                            Step 6 : Make a decision.       Step 7 : Check your work! Make sure your decision follows your gut instincts and your internal principles.      Write a memo to the Senator with a recommendation. Be sure to support your position and address counterarguments.    "

What is the interest rate and the number of borrowers and lenders if the market for loanable funds is in equilibrium?    Suppose the interest rate is 2.5%. Describe three steps of what happens to the market for loanable funds (you do not have to use precise numbers).    Suppose the central bank increases the supply of money. What will happen to the interest rate? Explain your reasoning with reference to .      Let be the number of borrowers (in millions) and be the number of lenders (in millions). Suppose the system of demand and supply equations for loanable funds is:    Find the equilibrium interest rate .      Assume that the continuously compounded annual risk-free interest rate is 2%. For each of the following scenarios, determine which component is behind the higher interest rates earned or paid. Assume all rates are annual and continuously compounded.    A savings account allows a depositor to make withdrawals on demand at no cost. A certificate of deposit has a maturity date, and withdrawals before the maturity date incur a penalty. The interest rate for the certificate of deposit is 2.5%.    A one-year zero-coupon bond has a yield rate of 3% while a thirty-year zero-coupon bond has a yield rate of 6%.    An investor expects consumer prices to rise at a 2.5% annual rate each year for the foreseeable future, so requires an interest rate of 4.5% in order to invest.    Treasury bills carry the risk free rate. A corporate bond with similar terms to treasury bill carries a 3.5% interest rate.      Suppose the risk-free interest rate is . Suppose we also know that for every 10,000 30-year mortgage loans, there will be 160 defaults. The average mortgage loan made by a local bank is in the amount of 500,000. Assume the loan is paid off by a lump sum at the end of the term. Find the interest rate the bank will charge on the mortgage loan assuming:    In the event of default, the bank recovers nothing.    In the event of default, by foreclosing on the property, the bank recovers 15% of the repayment amount.      Suppose a borrower takes out a loan of 100,000 and makes interest-only payments for 10 years, after which they pay the principal balance. The lender has inflation protection on the loan.  The payments for the first three years, and actual inflation rate for each year, are as follows:     Year  1  2  3    Payment  3561.97  3303.39  4602.79    Actual Inflation  2%  1.75%  3%     Assume there are no other adjustments to the interest rate.    Find the real interest rate paid by the borrower.    If the rate the bank charges for deferred consumption is , what is the rate paid by the lender for inflation protection?      A bank charges a nominal interest rate of 5% on its loans. Inflation is expected to be 3%, and as a matter of policy, the bank adds 50 basis points to expected inflation to account for error in its expectations. What rate does the bank charge for deferred consumption?      A bank charges a nominal interest rate of 6.5% on its loans without inflation protection, and a real interest rate of 6% on its loans with inflation protection. If the bank is not concerned with unexpected inflation and pays only a few basis points for inflation protection, what does the bank expect the inflation rate to be over the next few years?      A real estate developer borrows a 10-year, 10 million construction loan from a bank. The construction period is to last three years, during which the developer will make annual interest payments. Once construction is complete, the developer will make amortized principal and interest payments.  Suppose that the continuously compounded annual risk-free interest rate is . A bank takes the risk-free rate as its compensation for deferred consumption.  The data the bank has shows that similar loans made to borrowers with similar credit risks default during the construction phase 5% of the time, and never default after the construction phase. In the event of default, can recover 150,000 net of costs through foreclosure. The bank calculates the credit spread based on an assumption that principal and interest will be paid as a lump sum at the end of the construction period.  The bank also pays 1.25% for inflation protection.  If inflation in years 1, 2, and 3 is 2.3%, 1.9%, and 2.5% respectively, find the interest rate paid by the borrower in each of the first three years, along with the amount of the annual payment.      A business is issuing bonds to raise capital for a project with an unusually long term. As a result, they end up paying a higher interest rate on the new issue than they pay on their other bonds. For each of the following explanations, state the corresponding theory of maturity risk premium.    The investors targeted for the issue were concerned about having their funds tied up for a longer period of time.    Their investors typically purchased bonds from the company for shorter periods, and had to be incentivized to invest for a longer-term project.    Investors expected short-term interest rates to rise in the coming years.    The company was marketing the bonds to a class of investors different from those who hold their shorter-term bonds.      McCord Bank offers multiple investment accounts. Withdrawals from a \"Standard Savings Account\" can be made on demand. Withdrawals from a \"Superior Savings Account\" require 7 days to settle (meaning it takes 7 days to obtain your withdrawal), while withdrawals from a \"Premium Savings Account\" require 3 days to settle.  Rank the interest rates on the three accounts from highest to lowest.      Several factors impact the interest rates banks over savers and borrowers. For each of the following scenarios, identify the factor that is described.    Some years ago, a local bank ran into trouble by making several bad loans. Due to the volume of loan defaults, they had to rely on federal deposit insurance in order to satisfy depositor demands. Since then, this bank has offered savings accounts with higher interest rates than their competitors in town.    Coruscant is a very busy city with lots of business and development, while Tatooine is a remote desert outpost with few residents. Banks in Coruscant charge higher interest rates on their loans than banks in Tatooine.    A traditional bank has to pay rent for premises and pay for security for cash reserves. An online bank rents server farms, and holds only electronic reserves guarded by programmatic and encryption protection. The traditional bank charges higher interest rates for loans than the online bank.    A rural town with less than 15,000 residents has several banks, more than usual. One bank decides to increase its business in town by offering a higher savings account rate than their competitors.      Each of the following investors is in a fortunate position of having enough income to cover their household and personal expenses with funds left over. For each, advise them whether to put their excess funds in a savings account or in a certificate of deposit.    One family wants to have an emergency fund that can earn some interest when not needed, but draw on if an unexpected expense occurs or if someone loses their jobs.    Another family wants to put some money away to earn interest in order to make a major purchase in six months.      Rank the following credit cards from largest interest rate to smallest.    A credit card issued to a moderately credit-worthy borrower, secured by a cash deposit equal to half of the credit limit.    A credit card issued to a moderately credit-worthy borrower, unsecured.    A credit card issued to a highly credit-worth borrower, secured by a cash deposit equal to the entire credit limit.    A credit card issued to a borrower with no credit history, unsecured.    A credit card issued to a moderately credit-worthy borrower, secured by a cash deposit equal to the entire credit limit.        Families like to invest in U.S. Treasury securities because of their low risk. Determine which type of treasury security each of the following families should invest in (Treasury Bills, Treasury Notes, or Treasury Bonds).    A young family wants to save for retirement.    A family wants to save some excess funds for a purchase to be made in 9 months.    Parents of a 10-year old child want to save for their child's college tuition.      A Treasury Inflation Protected Security is issued with term of 5 years, a face value of 1000 and a coupon rate of 5%. Determine the total amount of the payments made to the borrower in each of the following years (add amounts in the same year without regard for the time value of money) using the following annual CPI values (Year 0 = 100):     Year  1  2  3  4  5    CPI  101.2  96  101.45  102.01  101.67         Identify the type of government bond described.    Governor Eisler and the State of Ferris issue bonds to raise funds to pay for the construction of highways that will charge tolls.    The City of Actuaria issues bonds to raise funds for their general operating expenses.    The federal government issues bonds to pay for the national deficit.      An investor has income from both treasury securities and municipal bonds. It is tax time. Which income must be reported on the federal income tax return and which must be reported on the state income tax return?      A U.S. investor purchased a 9-month European bond denominated in Euros. The bond had a face value of 1000 euros, and was priced to yield an effective annual yield of 0.96% (European). The investor purchased the bond on January 1, 2020, when the exchange rate was 1.11 euro per US dollar. Nine months later, on October 1, 2020, when the bond matured, the exchange rate was 1.17 euro per US dollar. Determine the US effective annual yield earned by the investor.      A six month zero-coupon bond has a face value of 1000. Brokers are willing to purchase the bonds for 971.29 and sell the bonds for 980.58. Determine the bid-ask spread as an effective annual yield rate.      Rank the interest rates for the following corporate bonds from smallest to largest. Ties are allowed!    Corporation A has a low credit rating. They issue bonds that have a high bid-ask spread and are junior relative to previously issued bonds.    Corporation B has a low credit rating. They issue bonds that have a low bid-ask spread and have seniority over other bond issues.    Corporation C has a high credit rating. They issue bonds with a high bid-ask spread, are senior to other bond issues, and have a call provision.    Corporation D has a high credit rating. They issue bonds with a low bid-ask spread and are senior to other bond issues.        Which function of a central bank is represented by the following scenarios?    A commercial bank needs to borrow funds overnight to satisfy demands from savings account holders.    A customer pays for their coffee with a debit card. The customer banks with McCord Bank. The coffee house banks with Morejon Bank. Funds are transferred from McCord Bank\\textquotesingle s reserve account to Morejon Bank, and funds from McCord Bank are transferred back into their reserve account.      Suppose the statute authorizing the creation of a central bank in the Republic of Actuariastan reads as follows:  The Central Bank of Actuariastan has the following powers:    to establish, maintain, and update the mechanisms for transfers of payments between Registered Banks in the Republic of Actuariastan,    to hold deposits and make payments on behalf of the Republic of Actuariastan,    to facilitate transfers between the Central Bank of Actuariastan and foreign banks,    to lend funds to Registered Banks in the Republic of Actuariastan and to set the interest rate for loans to Registered Banks,    to issue Treasury Bonds, and    to repurchase Treasury Bonds.      Suppose the Central Bank of Actuariastan is concerned that the interest rate is too high and wants to reduce the interest rate. Which of the following strategies are authorized and will reduce the interest rate? Select all that apply.    Issue more currency into the country.    Withdraw currency from the country.    Issue Treasury Bonds.    Purchase Treasury Bonds.    Increase the interest rate charged for loans to other banks.    Reduce the interest rate charged to loans for other banks.

Determine which of the following statements on lending interest rates is\/are true:    All else being equal, the rate on a secured loan should be greater than the rate on an unsecured loan.    All else being equal, the rate on a loan with guaranteed repayment should be greater than the rate on a loan without guaranteed repayment.    All else being equal, the rate on a loan for a borrower with a high credit score should be lower compared to another borrower with a low credit score.         For a corporate bond, which of the following changes would cause the yield rate of the bond to decrease?    Decreasing the bond's liquidity.    Changing the bond's rating from A to AA.    Increasing the seniority of the bond.         Determine which of the following statements is true with respect to the characteristics of U.S. Treasury Bonds.    When the bond's coupons are indexed to inflation, the security is labeled a \"nominal return bond\" rather than a \"real return bond.\"    \"Real return bonds\" are more commonly issued than \"nominal return bonds.\"    The yields on \"nominal return bonds\" are considered risk-free because the purchasing power generated is known with certainty, in advance.    The U.S. government is able to assume inflation risk because its tax receipts are directly linked to inflation rates.    Theoretically, Treasury yields can form an inverted yield curve shape, but this phenomenon has not yet been observed in practice.         The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has decided to decrease the target level of the federal funds rate.  Determine the effect on the reserving and lending activity of U.S. banks.    It becomes more expensive for banks to run a shortfall in their reserve accounts; thus. banks will be motivated to write fewer loans, and the interest rates charged on these loans will decrease.    It becomes more expensive for banks to run a shortfall in their reserve accounts; thus, banks will be motivated to write fewer loans, and the interest rates charged on these loans will increase.

On a given day, the discount rate is 3.65%, the prime rate is 3.55%, the LIBOR is 3.30%, the federal funds rate is 3.25%, and the federal funds target rate is 3.20%.  On the same day, Bank XYZ's reserve balance held at the Federal Reserve is lower than the reserve requirement, and Bank XYZ needs to borrow from those member institutions of the Federal Reserve who have excess funds in their reserve. Let be the rate at which Bank XYZ borrows these excess funds.  Determine .       A U.S. T-Bill has a quoted rate of 8%, matures for 5000 in 90 days, and was purchased for .  A Canadian T-Bill has a quoted rate of 10%, matures for in 180 days, and was purchased for 4800.  Calculate .       A U.S. T-Bill that matures for 10,000 in 90 days costs 9800.  A Canadian T-Bill that matures for 10,000 in 180 days costs 9600.  Let and be the quoted rate of the U.S. T-Bill and Canadian T-Bill respectively.  Calculate .       A 90 day U.S. T-Bill can be purchased at with a quoted rate of 2.8%.  A 180-day Canadian T-Bill can be purchased at .  Both T-Bills mature at 10,000.  Calculate the quoted rate for the Canadian T-Bill.       Jenna decides to purchase a U.S. Treasury Bill for 95,000. The Treasury Bill matures in 180 days for 100,000.  Let be the quoted rate on this U.S. Treasury Bill.  Let be the effective yield on this U.S. Treasury Bill assuming a 365 day year.  Calculate .       James has a choice of the following two Treasury Bills:    A Government of Canada Treasury Bill for 98,000. The Canadian Treasury Bill matures in 120 days for 100,000.    A U.S. Treasury Bill for 98,000. The U.S. Treasury Bill matures in 120 days for 100,000.    Which of the following statements is NOT true.    The quoted rate for the Government of Canada Treasury Bill is 6.2075%.    The quoted rate for the Government of Canada Treasury Bill exceeds the quoted rate for the U.S. Treasury Bill.    The annual effective yield rate earned by the Government of Canada Treasury Bill is equal to the annual effective yield rate earned by the U.S. Treasury Bill.    The annual effective interest rate earned by the Government of Canada Treasury Bill is less than the quoted rate on the Government of Canada Treasury Bill.    The annual effective interest rate earned by the U.S. Treasury Bill is greater than the quoted rate on the U.S. Treasury Bill.         Determine which one of the following statements is false.    Both U.S. Treasury bonds and Government of Canada bonds are issued with terms to maturity of up to 30 years.    The yields on both the U.S. Treasury bonds and Government of Canada bonds are virtually risk-free.    Bonds are issued at the state\/provincial and local levels in both countries with default rates greater than at the national level.    For Government of Canada bonds denominated in Canadian dollars, yields are primarily based on the level of economic activity in Canada; for U.S. Treasury bonds denominated in U.S. dollars, yields are primarily based on the level of economic activity in the U.S.    For Government of Canada bonds denominated in U.S. dollars, yields should be identical to otherwise equivalent U.S. Treasury bonds because the liquidity risk of the Government of Canada bonds will be the same as the liquidity risk of the U.S. Treasury Bonds.
